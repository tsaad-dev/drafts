  Use Cases for MPLS Network Action Indicators and MPLS Ancillary Data
                    draft-ietf-mpls-mna-usecases-01

Abstract

   This document presents a number of use cases that have a common need
   for encoding network action indicators and associated ancillary data
   inside MPLS packets.  There has been significant recent interest in
   extending the MPLS data plane to carry such indicators and ancillary
   data to address a number of use cases that are described in this
   document.

   The use cases described in this document are not an exhaustive set,
   but rather the ones that are actively discussed by members of the
   IETF MPLS, PALS and DETNET working groups participating in the MPLS
   Open Design Team.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes important cases that require carrying
   additional ancillary data within the MPLS packets, as well as means
   to indicate the ancillary data is present, and a specific action
   needs to be performed on the packet.

   These use cases have been identified by the MPLS Working Group Open
   Design Team working on defining MPLS Network Actions for the MPLS
   data plane.  The MPLS Ancillary Data (AD) can be classified as:

   *  implicit, or "no-data" associated with a Network Action (NA)
      indicator,

   *  residing within the MPLS label stack and referred to as In Stack
      Data (ISD), and

   *  residing after the Bottom of MPLS label Stack (BoS) and referred
      to as Post Stack Data (PSD).

   The use cases described in this document will be used to assist in
   identifying requirements and issues to be considered for future
   resolution by the working group.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in the document:

   IETF Network Slice:
      a well-defined composite of a set of endpoints, the connectivity
      requirements between subsets of these endpoints, and associated
      requirements; the term 'network slice' in this document refers to
      'IETF network slice' as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   Time-Bound Networking:
      Networks that transport time-bounded traffic.

1.2.  Acronyms and Abbreviations

      ISD: In-stack data

      PSD: Post-stack data

      MNA: MPLS Network Action

      NAI: Network Action Indicator

      AD: Ancillary Data

2.  Use Cases

2.1.  No Further Fastreroute

   MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) [RFC4090], [RFC5286] and [RFC7490] is a
   useful and widely deployed tool for minimizing packet loss in the
   case of a link or node failure.

   Several cases exist where, once FRR has taken place in an MPLS
   network and resulted in rerouting a packet away from the failure, a
   second FRR that impacts the same packet to rerouting is not helpful,
   and may even be disruptive.



Saad, et al.              Expires 27 April 2023                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                MNA Usecases                  October 2022


   For example, in such a case, the packet may continue to loop until
   its TTL expires.  This can lead to link congestion and further packet
   loss.  Thus, the attempt to prevent a packet from being dropped may
   instead affect many other packets.  A proposal to address this is
   presented in [I-D.kompella-mpls-nffrr].

2.2.  In-situ OAM

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used to
   collect operational and telemetry information while packets traverses
   a particular path in a network domain.

   The term "in-situ" refers to the fact that the IOAM data fields are
   added to the data packets rather than being sent within the probe
   packets specifically dedicated to OAM or Performance Measurement
   (PM).

   IOAM can run in two modes Edge-to-Edge (E2E) and Hop-by-Hop (HbH).
   In E2E mode, only the encapsulating and decapsulating nodes will
   process IOAM data fields.  In HbH mode, the encapsulating and
   decapsulating nodes as well as intermediate IOAM-capable nodes
   process IOAM data fields.  The IOAM data fields are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], and can be used for various use-cases of
   OAM and PM.

   Several IOAM Options have been defined:

   *  Pre-allocated and Incremental

   *  Edge-to-Edge

   *  Proof-of-Transit

   [I-D.gandhi-mpls-ioam-sr] defines how IOAM data fields are
   transported using the MPLS data plane encapsulations, including
   Segment Routing (SR) with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS).

   The IOAM data may be added after the bottom of the MPLS label stack.
   The IOAM data fields can be of fixed or incremental size as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  [I-D.gandhi-mpls-ioam] describes the
   applicability of IOAM to MPLS dataplane.  The encapsulating MPLS node
   needs to know if the decapsulating MPLS node can process the IOAM
   data before adding it in the packet.  In HbH IOAM mode, nodes that
   are capable of processing IOAM will intercept and process the IOAM
   data accordingly.  The presence of IOAM header and optional IOAM data
   will betransparent to nodes that do not support or do not participate
   in the IOAM process.

2.2.1.  In-situ OAM Direct Export

   IOAM Direct Export (DEX) [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export] is an
   IOAM Option-Type in which the operational state and telemetry
   information is collected according to the specified profile and
   exported in a manner and format defined by a local policy.

   In IOAM DEX, the user data packet is only used to trigger the IOAM
   data to be directly exported or locally aggregated without being
   pushed into in-flight data packets.

2.3.  Network Slicing

   An IETF Network Slice service provides connectivity coupled with a
   set of network resource commitments and is expressed in terms of one
   or more connectivity constructs.  A slice-flow aggregate
   [I-D.bestbar-teas-ns-packet] refers to the set of traffic streams
   from one or more connectivity constructs belonging to one or more
   IETF Network Slices that are mapped to a set of network resources and
   provided the same forwarding treatment.  The packets associated with
   a slice-flow aggregate may carry a marking in the packet's network
   layer header to identify this association and this marking is
   referred to as Flow-Aggregate Selector (FAS).  The FAS is used to map
   the packet to the associated set of network resources and provide the
   corresponding forwarding treatment to the packet.

   A router that requires forwarding of a packet that belongs to a
   slice-flow aggregate may have to decide on the forwarding action to
   take based on selected next-hop(s), and the forwarding treatment
   (e.g., scheduling and drop policy) to enforce based on the associated
   per-hop behavior.

   In this case, the routers that forward traffic over resources that
   are shared by multiple slice-flow aggregates need to identify the
   slice aggregate packets in order to enforce the associated forwarding
   action and treatment.

   MNA can be used to indicate the action and carry ancillary data for
   packets traversing Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  An MNA network
   action can be used to carry the FAS in MPLS packets.

2.3.1.  Dedicated Identifier as Flow-Aggregate Selector

   A dedicated Identifier that is independent of forwarding can be
   carried in the packet as a Flow-Aggregate Selector (FAS).  This can
   be encoded in the MPLS packet as defined in
   [I-D.kompella-mpls-mspl4fa], [I-D.li-mpls-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id], and
   [I-D.decraene-mpls-slid-encoded-entropy-label-id].  The FAS is used
   to associate the packets belonging to Slice-Flow Aggregate to the
   underlying Network Resource Partition (NRP) as described in
   [I-D.bestbar-teas-ns-packet].

   When MPLS packets carry a dedicated FAS identifier, the MPLS LSRs use
   the forwarding label to select the forwarding next-hop(s), and use
   the FAS in the MPLS packet to infer the specific forwarding treatment
   that needs to be applied on the packet.

   The FAS can be encoded within an MPLS label carried in the packet's
   MPLS label stack.  All MPLS packets that belong to the same flow
   aggregate MAY carry the same FAS identifier.

2.3.2.  Forwarding Label as a Flow-Aggregate Selector

   [RFC3031] states in Section 2.1 that: 'Some routers analyze a
   packet's network layer header not merely to choose the packet's next
   hop, but also to determine a packet's "precedence" or "class of
   service"'.

   It is possible by assigning a unique MPLS forwarding label to each
   flow aggregate (FEC) to distinguish the packets forwarded to the same
   destination. from other flow aggregates.  In this case, LSRs can use
   the top forwarding label to infer both the forwarding action and the
   forwarding treatment to be invoked on the packets.

2.4.  Generic Delivery Functions

   The Generic Delivery Functions (GDF), defined in
   [I-D.zzhang-intarea-generic-delivery-functions], provide a new
   mechanism to support functions analogous to those supported through
   the IPv6 Extension Headers mechanism.  For example, GDF can support
   fragmentation/reassembly functionality in the MPLS network by using
   the Generic Fragmentation Header.  MNA can support GDF by placing a
   GDF header in an MPLS packet within the Post-Stack Data block
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-mna-fwk].  Multiple GDF headers can also be present in
   the same MPLS packet organized as a list of headers.

2.5.  Delay Budgets for Time-Bound Applications

   The routers in a network can perform two distinct functions on
   incoming packets, namely forwarding (where the packet should be sent)
   and scheduling (when the packet should be sent).  IEEE-802.1 Time
   Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking provide
   several mechanisms for scheduling under the assumption that routers
   are time-synchronized.  The most effective mechanisms for delay
   minimization involve per-flow resource allocation.

   Segment Routing (SR) is a forwarding paradigm that allows encoding
   forwarding instructions in the packet in a stack data structure,
   rather than being programmed into the routers.  The SR instructions
   are contained within a packet in the form of a First-in First-out
   stack dictating the forwarding decisions of successive routers.
   Segment routing may be used to choose a path sufficiently short to be
   capable of providing a bounded end-to-end latency but does not
   influence the queueing of individual packets in each router along
   that path.

   When carried over the MPLS data plane, a solution is required to
   enable the delivery of such packets that can be delivered to their
   final destination by a given time budget.

2.5.1.  Stack Based Methods for Latency Control

   One efficient data structure for inserting local deadlines into the
   headers is a "stack", similar to that used in Segment Routing to
   carry forwarding instructions.  The number of deadline values in the
   stack equals the number of routers the packet needs to traverse in
   the network, and each deadline value corresponds to a specific
   router.  The Top-of-Stack (ToS) corresponds to the first router's
   deadline while the Bottom-of-Stack (BoS) refers to the last's.  All
   local deadlines in the stack are later or equal to the current time
   (upon which all routers agree), and times closer to the ToS are
   always earlier or equal to times closer to the BoS.

   The ingress router inserts the deadline stack into the packet
   headers; no other router needs to be aware of the requirements of the
   time-bound flows.  Hence admitting a new flow only requires updating
   the information base of the ingress router.

   MPLS LSRs that expose the Top of Stack (ToS) label can also inspect
   the associated "deadline" carried in the packet (either in MPLS stack
   as ISD or after BoS as PSD).

2.6.  NSH-based Service Function Chaining

   [RFC8595] describes how Service Function Chaining (SFC) can be
   realized in an MPLS network by emulating the NSH by using only MPLS
   label stack elements.

   The approach in [RFC8595] introduces some limitations that are
   discussed in [I-D.lm-mpls-sfc-path-verification].  This approach,
   however, can benefit from the framework introduced with MNA
   [I-D.andersson-mpls-mna-fwk].

   For example, it may be possible to extend NSH emulation using MPLS
   labels [RFC8595] to support the functionality of NSH Context Headers,
   whether fixed or variable-length.  One of the use cases could support
   Flow ID [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh-tlv] that may be used for load-balancing
   among Service Function Forwarders (SFFs) and/or the Service Function
   (SF) within the same SFP.

2.7.  Network Programming

   In SR, an ingress node steers a packet through an ordered list of
   instructions, called "segments".  Each one of these instructions
   represents a function to be called at a specific location in the
   network.  A function is locally defined on the node where it is
   executed and may range from simply moving forward in the segment list
   to any complex user-defined behavior.

   Network Programming combines Segment Routing (SR) functions to
   achieve a networking objective that goes beyond mere packet routing.

   It may be desirable to encode a pointer to function and its arguments
   within an MPLS packet transport header.  For example, in MPLS we can
   encode the FUNC::ARGs within the label stack or after the Bottom of
   Stack to support the equivalent of FUNC::ARG in SRv6 as described in
   [RFC8986].

2.8.  Application Aware Networking

   Application-aware Networking (APN) as described in
   [I-D.li-apn-problem-statement-usecases] allows application-aware
   information (i.e., APN attributes) including APN identification (ID)
   and/or APN parameters (e.g.  network performance requirements) to be
   encapsulated at network edge devices and carried in packets
   traversing an APN domain.

Internet-Draft                MNA Usecases                  October 2022


   The APN data is carried in packets to facilitate service
   provisioning, and be used to perform fine-granularity traffic
   steering and network resource adjustment.  To support APN in MPLS
   networks, mechanisms are needed to carry such APN data in MPLS
   encapsulated packets.

3.  Co-existence of Usecases

   Two or more of the aforementioned use cases MAY co-exist in the same
   packet.  This may require the presence of multiple ancilary data
   (whether In-stack or Post-stack ancillary data) to be present in the
   same MPLS packet.

   For example, IOAM may provide key functions along with network
   slicing to help ensure that critical network slice SLOs are being met
   by the network provider.  In this case, IOAM is able to collect key
   performance measurement parameters of network slice traffic flows as
   it traverses the transport network.
