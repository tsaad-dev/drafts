              Realizing Network Slices in IP/MPLS Networks
                    draft-bestbar-teas-ns-packet-04

Abstract

   Network slicing provides the ability to partition a physical network
   into multiple logical networks of varying sizes, structures, and
   functions so that each slice can be dedicated to specific services or
   customers.  Network slices need to operate in parallel while
   providing slice elasticity in terms of network resource allocation.
   The Differentiated Service (Diffserv) model allows for carrying
   multiple services on top of a single physical network by relying on
   compliant nodes to apply specific forwarding treatment (scheduling
   and drop policy) on to packets that carry the respective Diffserv
   code point.  This document proposes a solution based on the Diffserv
   model to realize network slicing in IP/MPLS networks.

1.  Introduction

   Network slicing allows a Service Provider to create independent and
   logical networks on top of a common or shared physical network
   infrastructure.  Such network slices can be offered to customers or
   used internally by the Service Provider to facilitate or enhance
   their service offerings.  A Service Provider can also use network
   slicing to structure and organize the elements of its infrastructure.
   This document provides a path control technology agnostic solution
   that a Service Provider can deploy to realize network slicing in IP/
   MPLS networks.

   The definition of network slice for use within the IETF and the
   characteristics of IETF network slice are specified in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].  A framework for
   reusing IETF VPN and traffic-engineering technologies to realize IETF
   network slices is discussed in [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework].  These
   documents also discuss the function of an IETF Network Slice
   Controller and the requirements on its northbound and southbound
   interfaces.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing          September 2021


   This document introduces the notion of a slice aggregate which
   comprises of one of more IETF network slice traffic streams.  It
   describes how a slice policy can be used to realize a slice aggregate
   by instantiating specific control and data plane behaviors on select
   topological elements in IP/MPLS networks.  The onus is on the IETF
   Network Slice Controller to maintain the mapping between one or more
   IETF network slices and a slice aggregate.  The mechanisms used by
   the controller to determine the mapping are outside the scope of this
   document.  The focus of this document is on the mechanisms required
   at the device level to address the requirements of network slicing in
   packet networks.

   In a Differentiated Service (Diffserv) domain [RFC2475], packets
   requiring the same forwarding treatment (scheduling and drop policy)
   are classified and marked with a Class Selector (CS) at domain
   ingress nodes.  At transit nodes, the CS field inside the packet is
   inspected to determine the specific forwarding treatment to be
   applied before the packet is forwarded further.  Similar principles
   are adopted by this document to realize network slicing.

   When logical networks representing slice aggregates are realized on
   top of a shared physical network infrastructure, it is important to
   steer traffic on the specific network resources allocated for the
   slice aggregate.  In packet networks, the packets that traverse a
   specific slice aggregate MAY be identified by one or more specific
   fields carried within the packet.  A slice policy ingress boundary
   node populates the respective field(s) in packets that enter a slice
   aggregate to allow interior slice policy nodes to identity those
   packets and apply the specific Per Hop Behavior (PHB) that is
   associated with the slice aggregate.  The PHB defines the scheduling
   treatment and, in some cases, the packet drop probability.

   The slice aggregate traffic may further carry a Diffserv CS to allow
   differentiation of forwarding treatments for packets within a slice
   aggregate.  For example, when using MPLS as a dataplane, it is
   possible to identify packets belonging to the same slice aggregate by
   carrying a global MPLS label in the label stack that identifies the
   slice aggregate in each packet.  Additional Diffserv classification
   may be indicated in the Traffic Class (TC) bits of the global MPLS
   label to allow further differentiation of forwarding treatments for
   traffic traversing the same slice aggregate network resources.

   This document covers different modes of slice policy and discusses
   how each slice policy mode can ensure proper placement of slice
   aggregate paths and respective treatment of slice aggregate traffic.

1.1.  Terminology

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the terminology specified
   in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] and
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework].

   The following terminology is used in the document:

   IETF network slice:
      a well-defined composite of a set of endpoints, the connectivity
      requirements between subsets of these endpoints, and associated
      requirements; the term 'network slice' in this document refers to
      'IETF network slice' as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].

   IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC):
      controller that is used to realize an IETF network slice
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].

   Slice policy:
      a policy construct that enables instantiation of mechanisms in
      support of IETF network slice specific control and data plane
      behaviors on select topological elements; the enforcement of a
      slice policy results in the creation of a slice aggregate.

   Slice aggregate:
      a collection of packets that match a slice policy selection
      criteria and are given the same forwarding treatment; a slice
      aggregate comprises of one or more IETF network slice traffic
      streams; the mapping of one or more IETF network slices to a slice
      aggregate is maintained by the IETF Network Slice Controller.

   Slice policy capable node:
      a node that supports one of the slice policy modes described in
      this document.

   Slice policy incapable node:
      a node that does not support any of the slice policy modes
      described in this document.

   Slice aggregate traffic:
      traffic that is forwarded over network resources associated with a
      specific slice aggregate.

   Slice aggregate path:
      a path that is setup over network resources associated with a
      specific slice aggregate.

   Slice aggregate packet:
      a packet that traverses network resources associated with a
      specific slice aggregate.

   Slice policy topology:
      a set of topological elements associated with a slice policy.

   Slice aggregate aware TE:
      a mechanism for TE path selection that takes into account the
      available network resources associated with a specific slice
      aggregate.

2.  Network Resource Slicing Membership

   A slice aggregate can be instantiated over parts of an IP/MPLS
   network (e.g., all or specific network resources in the access,
   aggregation, or core network), and can stretch across multiple
   domains administered by a provider.  A slice policy topology may
   include all or a sub-set of the physical nodes and links of an IP/
   MPLS network; it may be comprised of dedicated and/or shared network
   resources (e.g., in terms of processing power, storage, and
   bandwidth).

2.1.  Dedicated Network Resources

   Physical network resources may be fully dedicated to a specific slice
   aggregate.  For example, traffic belonging to a slice aggregate can
   traverse dedicated network resources without being subjected to
   contention from traffic of other slice aggregates.  Dedicated network
   resource slicing allows for simple partitioning of the physical
   network resources amongst slice aggregates without the need to
   distinguish packets traversing the dedicated network resources since
   only one slice aggregate traffic stream can traverse the dedicated
   resource at any time.

2.2.  Shared Network Resources

   To optimize network utilization, sharing of the physical network
   resources may be desirable.  In such case, the same physical network
   resource capacity is divided among multiple slice aggregates.  Shared
   network resources can be partitioned in the data plane (for example
   by applying hardware policers and shapers) and/or partitioned in the
   control plane by providing a logical representation of the physical
   link that has a subset of the network resources available to it.

3.  Network Slice Request Workflow

   Figure 1 describes the steps for the workflow required to realize an
   IETF network slice service in a provider network.  Each of steps is
   further elaborated on in a subsequent section.

     Figure 1: Workflow diagram for IETF network slice instantiation.

3.1.  Network Topology Filters (0)

   The Physical Network may be filtered into a number of Policy Filter
   Topologies.  Filter actions may include selection of specific nodes
   and links according to their capabilities and are based on network-
   wide policies.  The resulting topologies can be used to host IETF
   Network Slices and provide a useful way for the network operator to
   know that all of the resources they are using to plan a network slice
   meet specific SLOs.  This step in the work flow could be an early,
   offline planning activity or could be performed dynamically as new
   demands arise (specifically, concurrent with step 3).

   Section 5.1.4 describes how topology filters can be associated with a
   Slice Aggregate using the Slice Policy.

3.2.  IETF Network Slice Service Request (1)

   The customer requests an IETF Network Slice Service specifying the
   CE-AC-PE points of attachment, the connectivity matrix, and the SLOs
   as described in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].  These
   capabilities are always provided based on a Service Level Agreement
   (SLA) between the network slice consumer and the provider.

   This defines the traffic flows that need to be supported when the
   slice is realized.  Depending on the mechanism and encoding of the
   Attachment Circuit (AC), the IETF Network Slice Service may also
   include information that will allow the operator's controllers to
   configure the PEs (see step 6) to determine what customer traffic is
   intended for this IETF Network Slice.

   IETF Network Slice Service Requests are likely to arrive at various
   times in the life of the network, and may also be modified.

3.3.  Slice Aggregation Mapping (2)

   A network may be called upon to support very many IETF Network
   Slices, and this could present scaling challenges in the operation of
   the network.  In order to overcome this, the IETF Network Slices may
   be aggregated into groups according to similar characteristics.

   A Slice Aggregate is a construct that comprises the traffic flows of
   one or more IETF Network Slice.  The mapping of IETF Network Slices
   into an Slice Aggregate is a matter of local operator policy and is a
   function executed by a sub-component of the Controller.  The Slice
   Aggregate may be preconfigured, created on demand, or modified
   dynamically.

3.4.  Path Placement (3)

   Depending on the underlying network technology, a Controller may plan
   the paths that the traffic flows will take through the network in
   order to best deliver the SLOs for the different services in the
   Slice Aggregate.  A sub-component of the Controller performs this
   function on the Policy Filter Topology selected to support the Slice
   Aggregate.

   Note that this step may indicate the need to increase the capacity of
   the underlying Policy Filter Topology or to create a new Policy
   Filter Topology (see step 0).

3.5.  Slice Policy Installation (4)

   A sub-component of the Controller programs the physical network with
   policies for handling the traffic flows belonging to the Slice
   Aggregate.  These policies instruct network routers how to handle
   traffic for a specific Slice Aggregate: the routers correlate markers
   present in the packets that belong to the Slice Aggregate with the
   configured policy.  The way in which the Slice Policy is installed in
   the routers and the way that the traffic is marked is implementation
   specific.  The Slice Policy instantiation in the network is further
   described in Section 5.

3.6.  Path Instantiation (5)

   Depending on the underlying network technology, a sub-component of
   the Controller may install forwarding state specific to the Slice
   Aggregate so that traffic is routed along paths derived in step 3.
   The way in which the paths are instantiated is implementation
   specific.

3.7.  Service Mapping (6)

   Once the network has been set up, the edge points (PEs) can be
   configured to support the service.  This involves telling them what
   customer traffic should be mapped to which Slice Aggregate possibly
   using information supplied in step 1.  It also instructs the edge
   points how to mark the packets so that the network routers will know
   which policies and routing instructions (installed in steps 4 and 5)
   to apply.

3.8.  Network Slice Aggregate Relationships

   The following describes the generalization relationships between the
   IETF network slice and different parts of the solution as described
   in Figure 1.

   o A customer may request 1 or more IETF Network Slices.

   o Any given Attachment Circuit (AC) may support the traffic for 1 or
   more IETF Network Slice, but if there is more than one IETF Network
   Slice using a single AC, the IETF Network Slice Service request must
   include enough information to allow the edge nodes to demultiplex the
   traffic for the different IETF Network Slices.

   o By definition, multiple IETF Network Slices may be mapped to a
   single Slice Aggregate.  However, it is possible for an Slice
   Aggregate to contain just a single IETF Network Slice.  Furthermore,
   an Slice Aggregate can be planned and preconfigured, and may be
   "empty" having no IETF Network Slices mapped to it.

   o The physical network may be filtered to multiple Policy Filter
   Topologies.  Each such Policy Filter Topology provides a short-cut to
   planning the placement and support of Slice Aggregate by presenting
   only the subset of links and nodes that meet specific criteria.
   Note, however, that a network operator does not need to derive any
   Policy Filter Topologies, choosing to operate directly on the
   physical network.

   o It is anticipated that there may be very many IETF Network Slices
   supported by a network operator over a single physical network.  The
   scaling mechanisms are deployment choices, but it may be that there
   are no more than 1000 Slice Aggregate supported by a network, with
   each Slice Aggregate supporting any number of IETF Network Slices.

4.  Slice Policy Modes

   A slice policy can be used to dictate if the partitioning of the
   shared network resources amongst multiple slice aggregates can be
   achieved by realizing slice aggregates in:

   a)  data plane only, or

   b)  control plane only, or

   c)  both control and data planes.

4.1.  Data plane Slice Policy Mode

   The physical network resources can be partitioned on network devices
   by applying a Per Hop forwarding Behavior (PHB) onto packets that
   traverse the network devices.  In the Diffserv model, a Class
   Selector (CS) is carried in the packet and is used by transit nodes
   to apply the PHB that determines the scheduling treatment and drop
   probability for packets.



Saad, et al.             Expires March 25, 2022                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing          September 2021


   When data plane slice policy mode is applied, packets need to be
   forwarded on the specific slice aggregate network resources and need
   to be applied a specific forwarding treatment that is dictated in the
   slice policy (refer to Section 5.1 below).  A Slice Selector (SS)
   MUST be carried in each packet to identify the slice aggregate that
   it belongs to.

   The ingress node of a slice policy domain, in addition to marking
   packets with a Diffserv CS, MAY also add an SS to each slice
   aggregate packet.  The transit nodes within a slice policy domain MAY
   use the SS to associate packets with a slice aggregate and to
   determine the Slice policy Per Hop Behavior (S-PHB) that is applied
   to the packet (refer to Section 5.1.3 for further details).  The CS
   MAY be used to apply a Diffserv PHB on to the packet to allow
   differentiation of traffic treatment within the same slice aggregate.

   When data plane only slice policy mode is used, routers may rely on a
   network state independent view of the topology to determine the best
   paths to reach destinations.  In this case, the best path selection
   dictates the forwarding path of packets to the destination.  The SS
   field carried in each packet determines the specific S-PHB treatment
   along the selected path.

   For example, the Segment-Routing Flexible Algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] may be deployed in a network to steer
   packets on the IGP computed lowest cumulative delay path.  A slice
   policy may be used to allow links along the least latency path to
   share its data plane resources amongst multiple slice aggregates.  In
   this case, the packets that are steered on a specific slice policy
   carry the SS field that enables routers (along with the Diffserv CS)
   to determine the S-PHB and enforce slice aggregate traffic streams.

4.2.  Control Plane Slice Policy Mode

   The physical network resources in the network can be logically
   partitioned by having a representation of network resources appear in
   a virtual topology.  The virtual topology can contain all or a subset
   of the physical network resources by applying specific topology
   filters on the native topology.  The logical network resources that
   appear in the virtual topology can reflect a part, whole, or in-
   excess of the physical network resource capacity (when
   oversubscription is desirable).  For example, a physical link
   bandwidth can be divided into fractions, each dedicated to a slice
   aggregate.  Each fraction of the physical link bandwidth MAY be
   represented as a logical link in a virtual topology that is used when
   determining paths associated with a specific slice aggregate.  The
   virtual topology associated with the slice policy can be used by

   routing protocols, or by the ingress/PCE when computing slice
   aggregate aware TE paths.

   To perform network state dependent path computation in this mode
   (slice aggregate aware TE), the resource reservation on each link
   needs to be slice aggregate aware.  Details of required IGP
   extensions to support SA-TE are described in
   [I-D.bestbar-lsr-slice-aware-te].

   The same physical link may be member of multiple slice policies that
   instantiate different slice aggregates.  The slice aggregate network
   resource availability on such a link is updated (and may be
   advertised) whenever new paths are placed in the network.  The slice
   aggregate resource reservation, in this case, MAY be maintained on
   each device or off the device on a resource reservation manager that
   holds reservation states for those links in the network.

   Multiple slice aggregates can form a group and share the available
   network resources allocated to each slice aggregate.  In this case, a
   node can update the reservable bandwidth for each slice aggregate to
   take into consideration the available bandwidth from other slice
   aggregates in the same group.

   For illustration purposes, the diagram below represents bandwidth
   isolation or sharing amongst a group of slice aggregates.  In
   Figure 1a, the slice aggregates: S_AGG1, S_AGG2, S_AGG3 and S_AGG4
   are not sharing any bandwidths between each other.  In Figure 1b, the
   slice aggregates: S_AGG1 and S_AGG2 can share the available bandwidth
   portion allocated to each amongst them.  Similarly, S_AGG3 and S_AGG4
   can share amongst themselves any available bandwidth allocated to
   them, but they cannot share available bandwidth allocated to S_AGG1
   or S_AGG2.  In both cases, the Max Reservable Bandwidth may exceed
   the actual physical link resource capacity to allow for over
   subscription.

4.3.  Data and Control Plane Slice Policy Mode

   In order to support strict guarantees for slice aggregates, the
   network resources can be partitioned in both the control plane and
   data plane.

   The control plane partitioning allows the creation of customized
   topologies per slice aggregate that routers or a Path Computation

   Engine (PCE) can use to determine optimal path placement for specific
   demand flows (Slice aggregate aware TE).

   The data plane partitioning protects slice aggregate traffic from
   network resource contention that could occur due to bursts in traffic
   from other slice aggregates traversing the same shared network
   resource.

5.  Slice Policy Instantiation

   A network slice can span multiple technologies and multiple
   administrative domains.  Depending on the network slice consumer's
   requirements, a network slice can be differentiated from other
   network slices in terms of data, control or management planes.

   The consumer of a network slice expresses their intent by specifying
   requirements rather than mechanisms to realize the slice as described
   in Section 3.2.

   The network slice controller consumes the network slice service
   intent and realizes it with an appropriate slice policy.  Multiple
   IETF network slices MAY be mapped to the same slice policy resulting
   in a slice aggregate as described in Section 3.3.

   The network wide consistent slice policy definition is distributed to
   the devices in the network as shown in Figure 1.  The specification
   of the network slice intent on the northbound interface of the
   controller and the mechanism used to map the network slice to a slice
   policy are outside the scope of this document.

5.1.  Slice Policy Definition

   The slice policy is network-wide construct that is consumed by
   network devices, and may include rules that control the following:

   o  Data plane specific policies: This includes the SS, any firewall
      rules or flow-spec filters, and QoS profiles associated with the
      slice policy and any classes within it.

   o  Control plane specific policies: This includes guaranteed
      bandwidth, any network resource sharing amongst slice policies,
      and reservation preference to prioritize any reservations of a
      specific slice policy over others.

   o  Topology membership policies: This defines topology filter
      policies that dictate node/link/function network resource topology
      association for a specific slice policy.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing          September 2021


   There is a desire for flexibility in realizing network slices to
   support the services across networks consisting of products from
   multiple vendors.  These networks may also be grouped into disparate
   domains and deploy various path control technologies and tunnel
   techniques to carry traffic across the network.  It is expected that
   a standardized data model for slice policy will facilitate the
   instantiation and management of slice aggregates on slice policy
   capable nodes.  A YANG data model for the slice policy instantiation
   on network devices is described in
   [I-D.bestbar-teas-yang-slice-policy].

   It is also possible to distribute the slice policy to network devices
   using several mechanisms, including protocols such as NETCONF or
   RESTCONF, or exchanging it using a suitable routing protocol that
   network devices participate in (such as IGP(s) or BGP).  The
   extensions to enable specific protocols to carry a slice policy
   definition will be described in separate documents.

5.1.1.  Slice Policy Data Plane Selector

   A router MUST be able to identify a packet belonging to a slice
   aggregate before it can apply the associated forwarding treatment or
   S-PHB.  One or more fields within the packet MAY be used as an SS to
   do this.

   Forwarding Address Based Slice Selector:

      It is possible to assign a different forwarding address (or MPLS
      forwarding label in case of MPLS network) for each slice aggregate
      on a specific node in the network.  [RFC3031] states in
      Section 2.1 that: 'Some routers analyze a packet's network layer
      header not merely to choose the packet's next hop, but also to
      determine a packet's "precedence" or "class of service"'.
      Assigning a unique forwarding address (or MPLS forwarding label)
      to each slice aggregate allows slice aggregate packets destined to
      a node to be distinguished by the destination address (or MPLS
      forwarding label) that is carried in the packet.

      This approach requires maintaining per slice aggregate state for
      each destination in the network in both the control and data plane
      and on each router in the network.  For example, consider a
      network slicing provider with a network composed of 'N' nodes,
      each with 'K' adjacencies to its neighbors.  Assuming a node can
      be reached over 'M' different slice aggregates, the node assigns
      and advertises reachability to 'N' unique forwarding addresses, or
      MPLS forwarding labels.  Similarly, each node assigns a unique
      forwarding address (or MPLS forwarding label) for each of its 'K'
      adjacencies to enable strict steering over the adjacency for each

      slice.  The total number of control and data plane states that
      need to be stored and programmed in a router's forwarding is
      (N+K)*M states.  Hence, as 'N', 'K', and 'M' parameters increase,
      this approach suffers from scalability challenges in both the
      control and data planes.

   Global Identifier Based Slice Selector:

      A slice policy MAY include a Global Identifier Slice Selector
      (GISS) field as defined in [I-D.kompella-mpls-mspl4fa] that is
      carried in each packet in order to associate it to a specific
      slice aggregate, independent of the forwarding address or MPLS
      forwarding label that is bound to the destination.  Routers within
      the slice policy domain can use the forwarding address (or MPLS
      forwarding label) to determine the forwarding next-hop(s), and use
      the GISS field in the packet to infer the specific forwarding
      treatment that needs to be applied on the packet.

      The GISS can be carried in one of multiple fields within the
      packet, depending on the dataplane used.  For example, in MPLS
      networks, the GISS can be encoded within an MPLS label that is
      carried in the packet's MPLS label stack.  All packets that belong
      to the same slice aggregate MAY carry the same GISS in the MPLS
      label stack.  It is also possible to have multiple GISS's map to
      the same slice aggregate.

      The GISS can be encoded in an MPLS label and may appear in several
      positions in the MPLS label stack.  For example, the VPN service
      label may act as a GISS to allow VPN packets to be associated with
      a specific slice aggregate.  In this case, a single VPN service
      label acting as a GISS MAY be allocated by all Egress PEs of a
      VPN.  Alternatively, multiple VPN service labels MAY act as GISS's
      that map a single VPN to the same slice aggregate to allow for
      multiple Egress PEs to allocate different VPN service labels for a
      VPN.  In other cases, a range of VPN service labels acting as
      multiple GISS's MAY map multiple VPN traffic to a single slice
      aggregate.  An example of such deployment is shown in Figure 3.

           Figure 3: GISS or VPN label at bottom of label stack.

      In some cases, the position of the GISS may not be at a fixed
      position in the MPLS label header.  In this case, the GISS label
      can show up in any position in the MPLS label stack.  To enable a
      transit router to identify the position of the GISS label, a
      special purpose label (ideally a base special purpose label
      (bSPL)) can be used as a GISS label indicator.
      [I-D.kompella-mpls-mspl4fa] proposes a new bSPL called Forwarding
      Actions Identifier (FAI) that is assigned to alert of the presence
      of multiple actions and action data (including the presence of the
      GISS) that are carried within the MPLS label stack.  The slice
      policy ingress boundary node, in this case, imposes two labels:
      the FAI label and a forwarding actions label that includes the
      GISS to identify the slice aggregate that packets belong to as
      shown in Figure 4.

      [I-D.decraene-mpls-slid-encoded-entropy-label-id] also proposes to
      repurpose the ELI/EL [RFC6790] to carry the Slice Identifier in
      order to minimize the size of the MPLS stack and ease incremental
      deployment.

             Figure 4: FAI and GISS label in the label stack.

      When the slice is realized over an IP dataplane, the GISS can be
      encoded in the IP header.  For example, the SSL can be encoded in
      portion of the IPv6 Flow Label field as described in
      [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-stateless-slice-id].

5.1.2.  Slice Policy Resource Reservation

   Bandwidth and network resource allocation strategies for slice
   policies are essential to achieve optimal placement of paths within
   the network while still meeting the target SLOs.

   Resource reservation allows for the managing of available bandwidth
   and for prioritization of existing allocations to enable preference-
   based preemption when contention on a specific network resource
   arises.  Sharing of a network resource's available bandwidth amongst
   a group of slice policies may also be desirable.  For example, a
   slice aggregate may not always be using all of its reservable
   bandwidth; this allows other slice policies in the same group to use
   the available bandwidth resources.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing          September 2021


   Congestion on shared network resources may result from sub-optimal
   placement of paths in different slice policies.  When this occurs,
   preemption of some slice aggregate specific paths may be desirable to
   alleviate congestion.  A preference based allocation scheme enables
   prioritization of slice aggregate paths that can be preempted.

   Since network characteristics and its state can change over time, the
   slice policy topology and its state also need to be propagated in the
   network to enable ingress TE routers or Path Computation Engine
   (PCEs) to perform accurate path placement based on the current state
   of the slice policy network resources.

5.1.3.  Slice Policy Per Hop Behavior

   In Diffserv terminology, the forwarding behavior that is assigned to
   a specific class is called a Per Hop Behavior (PHB).  The PHB defines
   the forwarding precedence that a marked packet with a specific CS
   receives in relation to other traffic on the Diffserv-aware network.

   A Slice policy Per Hop Behavior (S-PHB) is the externally observable
   forwarding behavior applied to a specific packet belonging to a slice
   aggregate.  The goal of an S-PHB is to provide a specified amount of
   network resources for traffic belonging to a specific slice
   aggregate.  A single slice policy may also support multiple
   forwarding treatments or services that can be carried over the same
   logical network.

   The slice aggregate traffic may be identified at slice policy ingress
   boundary nodes by carrying a SS to allow routers to apply a specific
   forwarding treatment that guarantee the SLA(s).

   With Differentiated Services (Diffserv) it is possible to carry
   multiple services over a single converged network.  Packets requiring
   the same forwarding treatment are marked with a Class Selector (CS)
   at domain ingress nodes.  Up to eight classes or Behavior Aggregates
   (BAs) may be supported for a given Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)
   [RFC2475].  To support multiple forwarding treatments over the same
   slice aggregate, a slice aggregate packet MAY also carry a Diffserv
   CS to identify the specific Diffserv forwarding treatment to be
   applied on the traffic belonging to the same slice policy.

   At transit nodes, the CS field carried inside the packets are used to
   determine the specific PHB that determines the forwarding and
   scheduling treatment before packets are forwarded, and in some cases,
   drop probability for each packet.

5.1.4.  Slice Policy Topology

   A key element of the slice policy is a customized topology that may
   include the full or subset of the physical network topology.  The
   slice policy topology could also span multiple administrative domains
   and/or multiple dataplane technologies.

   A slice policy topology can overlap or share a subset of links with
   another slice policy topology.  A number of topology filtering
   policies can be defined as part of the slice policy to limit the
   specific topology elements that belong to a slice policy.  For
   example, a topology filtering policy can leverage Resource Affinities
   as defined in [RFC2702] to include or exclude certain links for a
   specific slice aggregate.  The slice policy may also include a
   reference to a predefined topology (e.g., derived from a Flexible
   Algorithm Definition (FAD) as defined in [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo], or
   Multi-Topology ID as defined [RFC4915].

5.2.  Slice Policy Boundary

   A network slice originates at the edge nodes of a network slice
   provider.  Traffic that is steered over the corresponding slice
   aggregate may traverse slice policy capable interior nodes as well as
   slice policy incapable interior nodes.

   The network slice may encompass one or more domains administered by a
   provider.  For example, an organization's intranet or an ISP.  The
   network provider is responsible for ensuring that adequate network
   resources are provisioned and/or reserved to support the SLAs offered
   by the network end-to-end.

5.2.1.  Slice Policy Edge Nodes

   Slice policy edge nodes sit at the boundary of a network slice
   provider network and receive traffic that requires steering over
   network resources specific to a slice aggregate.  These edge nodes
   are responsible for identifying slice aggregate specific traffic
   flows by possibly inspecting multiple fields from inbound packets
   (e.g., implementations may inspect IP traffic's network 5-tuple in
   the IP and transport protocol headers) to decide on which slice
   policy it can be steered.

   Network slice ingress nodes may condition the inbound traffic at
   network boundaries in accordance with the requirements or rules of
   each service's SLAs.  The requirements and rules for network slice
   services are set using mechanisms which are outside the scope of this
   document.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing          September 2021


   When data plane slice policy is applied, the slice policy ingress
   boundary nodes are responsible for adding a suitable SS onto packets
   that belong to specific slice aggregate.  In addition, edge nodes MAY
   mark the corresponding Diffserv CS to differentiate between different
   types of traffic carried over the same slice aggregate.

5.2.2.  Slice Policy Interior Nodes

   A slice policy interior node receives slice traffic and MAY be able
   to identify the packets belonging to a specific slice aggregate by
   inspecting the SS field carried inside each packet, or by inspecting
   other fields within the packet that may identify the traffic streams
   that belong to a specific slice aggregate.  For example, when data
   plane slice policy is applied, interior nodes can use the SS carried
   within the packet to apply the corresponding S-PHB forwarding
   behavior.  Nodes within the network slice provider network may also
   inspect the Diffserv CS within each packet to apply a per Diffserv
   class PHB within the slice policy, and allow differentiation of
   forwarding treatments for packets forwarded over the same slice
   aggregate network resources.

5.2.3.  Slice Policy Incapable Nodes

   Packets that belong to a slice aggregate may need to traverse nodes
   that are slice policy incapable.  In this case, several options are
   possible to allow the slice traffic to continue to be forwarded over
   such devices and be able to resume the slice policy forwarding
   treatment once the traffic reaches devices that are slice policy
   capable.

   When data plane slice policy is applied, packets carry a SS to allow
   slice interior nodes to identify them.  To enable end-to-end network
   slicing, the SS MUST be maintained in the packets as they traverse
   devices within the network - including slice policy incapable
   devices.

   For example, when the SS is an MPLS label at the bottom of the MPLS
   label stack, packets can traverse over devices that are slice policy
   incapable without any further considerations.  On the other hand,
   when the SSL is at the top of the MPLS label stack, packets can be
   bypassed (or tunneled) over the slice policy incapable devices
   towards the next device that supports slice policy as shown in
   Figure 5.

5.2.4.  Combining Slice Policy Modes

   It is possible to employ a combination of the slice policy modes that
   were discussed in Section 4 to realize a network slice.  For example,
   data and control plane slice policy mode can be employed in parts of
   a network, while control plane slice policy mode can be employed in
   the other parts of the network.  The path selection, in such case,
   can take into account the slice aggregate specific available network
   resources.  The SS carried within packets allow transit nodes to
   enforce the corresponding S-PHB on the parts of the network that
   apply the data plane slice policy mode.  The SS can be maintained
   while traffic traverses nodes that do not enforce data plane slice

   policy mode, and so slice PHB enforcement can resume once traffic
   traverses capable nodes.

5.3.  Mapping Traffic on Slice Aggregates

   The usual techniques to steer traffic onto paths can be applicable
   when steering traffic over paths established for a specific slice
   aggregate.

   For example, one or more (layer-2 or layer-3) VPN services can be
   directly mapped to paths established for a slice aggregate.  In this
   case, the per Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance traffic
   that arrives on the Provider Edge (PE) router over external
   interfaces can be directly mapped to a specific slice aggregate path.
   External interfaces can be further partitioned (e.g., using VLANs) to
   allow mapping one or more VLANs to specific slice aggregate paths.

   Another option is steer traffic to specific destinations directly
   over multiple slice policies.  This allows traffic arriving on any
   external interface and targeted to such destinations to be directly
   steered over the slice paths.

   A third option that can also be used is to utilize a data plane
   firewall filter or classifier to enable matching of several fields in
   the incoming packets to decide whether the packet is steered on a
   specific slice aggregate.  This option allows for applying a rich set
   of rules to identify specific packets to be mapped to a slice
   aggregate.  However, it requires data plane network resources to be
   able to perform the additional checks in hardware.

6.  Path Selection and Instantiation

6.1.  Applicability of Path Selection to Slice Aggregates

   The path selection in the network can be network state dependent, or
   network state independent as described in Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis].  The latter is the choice commonly used
   by IGPs when selecting a best path to a destination prefix, while the
   former is used by ingress TE routers, or Path Computation Engines
   (PCEs) when optimizing the placement of a flow based on the current
   network resource utilization.

   For example, when steering traffic on a delay optimized path, the IGP
   can use its link state database's view of the network topology to
   compute a path optimizing for the delay metric of each link in the
   network resulting in a cumulative lowest delay path.





Saad, et al.             Expires March 25, 2022                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing          September 2021


   When path selection is network state dependent, the path computation
   can leverage Traffic Engineering mechanisms (e.g., as defined in
   [RFC2702]) to compute feasible paths taking into account the incoming
   traffic demand rate and current state of network.  This allows
   avoiding overly utilized links, and reduces the chance of congestion
   on traversed links.

   To enable TE path placement, the link state is advertised with
   current reservations, thereby reflecting the available bandwidth on
   each link.  Such link reservations may be maintained centrally on a
   network wide network resource manager, or distributed on devices (as
   usually done with RSVP).  TE extensions exist today to allow IGPs
   (e.g., [RFC3630] and [RFC5305]), and BGP-LS [RFC7752] to advertise
   such link state reservations.

   When network resource reservations are also slice aggregate aware,
   the link state can carry per slice aggregate state (e.g., reservable
   bandwidth).  This allows path computation to take into account the
   specific network resources available for a slice aggregate when
   determining the path for a specific flow.  In this case, we refer to
   the process of path placement and path provisioning as slice
   aggregate aware TE.

6.2.  Applicability of Path Control Technologies to Slice Aggregates

   The slice policy modes described in this document are agnostic to the
   technology used to setup paths that carry slice aggregate traffic.
   One or more paths connecting the endpoints of the mapped IETF network
   slices may be selected to steer the corresponding traffic streams
   over the resources allocated for the slice aggregate.

   The feasible paths can be computed using the slice policy topology
   and network state subject the optimization metrics and constraints.

6.3.  RSVP-TE Based Slice Aggregate Paths

   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] can be used to signal LSPs over the computed
   feasible paths in order to carry the slice aggregate traffic.  The
   specific extensions to the RSVP-TE protocol required to enable
   signaling of slice aggregate aware RSVP LSPs are are outside the
   scope of this document.

6.4.  SR Based Slice Aggregate Paths

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] can be used to setup and steer traffic
   over the computed slice aggregate feasible paths.





Saad, et al.             Expires March 25, 2022                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing          September 2021


   The SR architecture defines a number of building blocks that can be
   leveraged to support the realization of slice aggregate in an SR
   network.

   Such building blocks include:

   o  SR Policy with or without Flexible Algorithm.

   o  Steering of services (e.g.  VPN) traffic over SR paths

   o  SR Operation, Administration and Management (OAM) and Performance
      Management (PM)

   SR allows a headend node to steer packets onto specific SR paths
   using a Segment Routing Policy (SR Policy).  The SR policy supports
   various optimization objectives and constraints and can be used to
   steer slice aggregate trafffic in the SR network.

   The SR policy can be instantiated with or without the IGP Flexible
   Algorithm feature.  The slice aggregate traffic can be associated
   with a specific One or more slice policies can share an SR Flexible-
   Algorithm topology and optimization objective to steer slice
   aggregate traffic over the Flex-algo computed paths.

   Further details on how the slice policy modes presented in this
   document can be realized in an SR network are discussed in
   [I-D.bestbar-spring-scalable-ns], and [I-D.bestbar-lsr-spring-sa].

7.  Slice Policy Protocol Extensions

   Routing protocols may need to be extended to carry additional per
   slice aggregate link state.  For example, [RFC5305], [RFC3630], and
   [RFC7752] are ISIS, OSPF, and BGP protocol extensions to exchange
   network link state information to allow ingress TE routers and PCE(s)
   to do proper path placement in the network.  The extensions required
   to support network slicing may be defined in other documents, and are
   outside the scope of this document.

   The instantiation of a slice policy may need to be automated.
   Multiple options are possible to facilitate automation of
   distribution of a slice policy to capable devices.

   For example, a YANG data model for the slice policy may be supported
   on network devices and controllers.  A suitable transport (e.g.,
   NETCONF [RFC6241], RESTCONF [RFC8040], or gRPC) may be used to enable
   configuration and retrieval of state information for slice policies
   on network devices.  The slice policy YANG data model is outside the

   scope of this document, and is defined in
   [I-D.bestbar-teas-yang-slice-policy].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

9.  Security Considerations

   The main goal of network slicing is to allow for varying treatment of
   traffic from multiple different network slices that are utilizing a
   common network infrastructure and to allow for different levels of
   services to be provided for traffic traversing a given network
   resource.

   A variety of techniques may be used to achieve this, but the end
   result will be that some packets may be mapped to specific resources
   and may receive different (e.g., better) service treatment than
   others.  The mapping of network traffic to a specific slice policy is
   indicated primarily by the SS, and hence an adversary may be able to
   utilize resources allocated to a specific slice policy by injecting
   packets carrying the same SS field in their packets.

   Such theft-of-service may become a denial-of-service attack when the
   modified or injected traffic depletes the resources available to
   forward legitimate traffic belonging to a specific slice policy.

   The defense against this type of theft and denial-of-service attacks
   consists of a combination of traffic conditioning at slice policy
   domain boundaries with security and integrity of the network
   infrastructure within a slice policy domain.
