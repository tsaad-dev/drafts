              Realizing Network Slices in IP/MPLS Networks
                    draft-bestbar-teas-ns-packet-05

Abstract

   Network slicing provides the ability to partition a physical network
   into multiple logical networks of varying sizes, structures, and
   functions so that each slice can be dedicated to specific services or
   customers.  Network slices need to operate in parallel while
   providing slice elasticity in terms of network resource allocation.
   The Differentiated Service (Diffserv) model allows for carrying
   multiple services on top of a single physical network by relying on
   compliant nodes to apply specific forwarding treatment (scheduling
   and drop policy) on to packets that carry the respective Diffserv
   code point.  This document adopts the Diffserv principles and
   proposes a scalable approach to realize network slicing in IP/MPLS
   networks.  The solution does not mandate Diffserv to be enabled in
   the network to provide a specific forwarding treatment, but can co-
   exist with and complement it when enabled.

1.  Introduction

   Network slicing allows a Service Provider to create independent and
   logical networks on top of a common or shared physical network
   infrastructure.  Such network slices can be offered to customers or
   used internally by the Service Provider to facilitate or enhance
   their service offerings.  A Service Provider can also use network
   slicing to structure and organize the elements of its infrastructure.
   This document provides a path control technology agnostic solution
   that a Service Provider can deploy to realize network slicing in IP/
   MPLS networks.

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] specifies the definition of a
   network slice for use within the IETF and discusses the general
   framework for requesting and operating IETF Network Slices, their
   characteristics, and the necessary system components and interfaces.
   It also discusses the function of an IETF Network Slice Controller
   and the requirements on its northbound and southbound interfaces.

   This document introduces the notion of a Slice-Flow Aggregate which
   comprises of one of more IETF network slice traffic streams.  It also
   describes the Network Resource Partition (NRP) and the NRP Policy

   that can be used to instantiate control and data plane behaviors on
   select topological elements associated with the NRP that supports a
   Slice-Flow Aggregate - refer Section 5.1 for further details.

   The IETF Network Slice Controller is responsible for the aggregation
   of multiple IETF network traffic streams into a Slice-Flow Aggregate,
   and for maintaining the mapping required between them.  The
   mechanisms used by the controller to determine the mapping of one or
   more IETF network slice to a Slice-Flow Aggregate are outside the
   scope of this document.  The focus of this document is on the
   mechanisms required at the device level to address the requirements
   of network slicing in packet networks.

   In a Differentiated Service (Diffserv) domain [RFC2475], packets
   requiring the same forwarding treatment (scheduling and drop policy)
   are classified and marked with a Class Selector (CS) at domain
   ingress nodes.  At transit nodes, the CS field inside the packet is
   inspected to determine the specific forwarding treatment to be
   applied before the packet is forwarded further.  Similar principles
   are adopted by this document to realize network slicing.  The
   solution proposed in this document does not mandate Diffserv to be
   enabled in the network to provide a specific forwarding treatment.

   When logical networks associated with an NRP are realized on top of a
   shared physical network infrastructure, it is important to steer
   traffic on the specific network resources partition that is allocated
   for the Slice-Flow Aggregate.  In packet networks, the packets of a
   specific Slice-Flow Aggregate MAY be identified by one or more
   specific fields carried within the packet.  An NRP ingress boundary
   node populates the respective field(s) in packets that are mapped to
   a Slice-Flow Aggregate in order to allow interior NRP nodes to
   identify and apply the specific Per Hop Behavior (PHB) associated
   with the Slice-Flow Aggregate.  The PHB defines the scheduling
   treatment and, in some cases, the packet drop probability.

   If Diffserv is enabled within the network, the Slice-Flow Aggregate
   traffic can further carry a Diffserv CS to enable differentiation of
   forwarding treatments for packets within the same Slice-Flow
   Aggregate.

   For example, when using MPLS as a dataplane, it is possible to
   identify packets belonging to the same Slice-Flow Aggregate by
   carrying an identifier in an MPLS Label Stack Entry (LSE).
   Additional Diffserv classification may be indicated in the Traffic
   Class (TC) bits of the global MPLS label to allow further
   differentiation of forwarding treatments for traffic traversing the
   same NRP.

   This document covers different modes of NRPs and discusses how each
   mode can ensure proper placement of Slice-Flow Aggregate paths and
   respective treatment of Slice-Flow Aggregate traffic.

1.1.  Terminology

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the terminology specified
   in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   The following terminology is used in the document:

   IETF Network Slice:
      a well-defined composite of a set of endpoints, the connectivity
      requirements between subsets of these endpoints, and associated
      requirements; the term 'network slice' in this document refers to
      'IETF network slice' as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC):
      controller that is used to realize an IETF network slice
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   Network Resource Partition:
      the collection of resources that are used to support a Slice-Flow
      Aggregate.

   Slice-Flow Aggregate:
      a collection of packets that match an NRP Policy selection
      criteria and are given the same forwarding treatment; a Slice-Flow
      Aggregate comprises of one or more IETF network slice traffic
      streams; the mapping of one or more IETF network slices to a
      Slice-Flow Aggregate is maintained by the IETF Network Slice
      Controller.

   Network Resource Partition Policy:
      a policy construct that enables instantiation of mechanisms in
      support of IETF network slice specific control and data plane
      behaviors on select topological elements; the enforcement of an
      NRP Policy results in the creation of an NRP.

   NRP Capable Node:
      a node that supports one of the NRP modes described in this
      document.

   NRP Incapable Node:
      a node that does not support any of the NRP modes described in
      this document.

   Slice-Flow Aggregate Path:
      a path that is setup over the NRP that is associated with a
      specific Slice-Flow Aggregate.

   Slice-Flow Aggregate Packet:
      a packet that traverses over the NRP that is associated with a
      specific Slice-Flow Aggregate.

   NRP Topology:
      a set of topological elements associated with a Network Resource
      Partition.

   Slice-Flow Aggregate Aware TE:
      a mechanism for TE path selection that takes into account the
      available network resources associated with a specific Slice-Flow
      Aggregate.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Network Resource Slicing Membership

   An NRP that supports a Slice-Flow Aggregate can be instantiated over
   parts of an IP/MPLS network (e.g., all or specific network resources
   in the access, aggregation, or core network), and can stretch across
   multiple domains administered by a provider.  The NRP topology may be
   comprised of dedicated and/or shared network resources (e.g., in
   terms of processing power, storage, and bandwidth).

   The physical network resources may be fully dedicated to a specific
   Slice-Flow Aggregate.  For example, traffic belonging to a Slice-Flow
   Aggregate can traverse dedicated network resources without being
   subjected to contention from traffic of other Slice-Flow Aggregates.
   Dedicated physical network resource slicing allows for simple
   partitioning of the physical network resources amongst Slice-Flow
   Aggregates without the need to distinguish packets traversing the
   dedicated network resources since only one Slice-Flow Aggregate
   traffic stream can traverse the dedicated resource at any time.

   To optimize network utilization, sharing of the physical network
   resources may be desirable.  In such case, the same physical network
   resource capacity is divided among multiple NRPs that support
   multiple Slice-Flow Aggregates.  The shared physical network
   resources can be partitioned in the data plane (for example by
   applying hardware policers and shapers) and/or partitioned in the
   control plane by providing a logical representation of the physical
   link that has a subset of the network resources available to it.

3.  IETF Network Slice Realization

   Figure 1 describes the steps required to realize an IETF network
   slice service in a provider network using the solution proposed in
   this document.  Each of the steps is further elaborated on in a
   subsequent section.

            Figure 1: IETF network slice realization steps.

3.1.  Network Topology Filters

   The Physical Network may be filtered into a number of Policy Filter
   Topologies.  Filter actions may include selection of specific nodes
   and links according to their capabilities and are based on network-
   wide policies.  The resulting topologies can be used to host IETF
   Network Slices and provide a useful way for the network operator to
   know that all of the resources they are using to plan a network slice
   meet specific SLOs.  This step can be done offline during planning
   activity, or could be performed dynamically as new demands arise.

   Section 5.1.4 describes how topology filters can be associated with
   the NRP instantiated by the NRP Policy.

3.2.  IETF Network Slice Service Request

   The customer requests an IETF Network Slice Service specifying the
   CE-AC-PE points of attachment, the connectivity matrix, and the SLOs
   as described in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].  These
   capabilities are always provided based on a Service Level Agreement
   (SLA) between the network slice costumer and the provider.

   This defines the traffic flows that need to be supported when the
   slice is realized.  Depending on the mechanism and encoding of the
   Attachment Circuit (AC), the IETF Network Slice Service may also
   include information that will allow the operator's controllers to
   configure the PEs to determine what customer traffic is intended for
   this IETF Network Slice.

   IETF Network Slice Service Requests are likely to arrive at various
   times in the life of the network, and may also be modified.

3.3.  Slice-Flow Aggregation Mapping

   A network may be called upon to support very many IETF Network
   Slices, and this could present scaling challenges in the operation of
   the network.  In order to overcome this, the IETF Network Slices may
   be aggregated into groups according to similar characteristics.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


   A Slice-Flow Aggregate is a construct that comprises the traffic
   flows of one or more IETF Network Slices.  The mapping of IETF
   Network Slices into an Slice-Flow Aggregate is a matter of local
   operator policy is a function executed by the Controller.  The Slice-
   Flow Aggregate may be preconfigured, created on demand, or modified
   dynamically.

3.4.  Path Placement over Slice-Flow Aggregate Topology

   Depending on the underlying network technology, a Controller may plan
   the paths that the traffic flows will take through the network in
   order to best deliver the SLOs for the different services in the
   Slice-Flow Aggregate.  The Controller performs the path placement
   function on the Policy Filter Topology selected to support the Slice-
   Flow Aggregate.

   Note that this step may indicate the need to increase the capacity of
   the underlying Policy Filter Topology or to create a new Policy
   Filter Topology.

3.5.  NRP Policy Installation

   A Controller function programs the physical network with policies for
   handling the traffic flows belonging to the Slice-Flow Aggregate.
   These policies instruct network routers how to handle traffic for a
   specific Slice-Flow Aggregate: the routers correlate markers present
   in the packets that belong to the Slice-Flow Aggregate.  The way in
   which the NRP Policy is installed in the routers and the way that the
   traffic is marked is implementation specific.  The NRP Policy
   instantiation in the network is further described in Section 5.

3.6.  Path Instantiation

   Depending on the underlying network technology, a Controller function
   may install the forwarding state specific to the Slice-Flow Aggregate
   so that traffic is routed along paths derived in the Path Placement
   step described in Section 3.4.  The way in which the paths are
   instantiated is implementation specific.

3.7.  Service Mapping

   Once the network has been set up, the edge points (PEs) can be
   configured to support the service.  This involves telling them what
   customer traffic should be mapped to which Slice-Flow Aggregate
   possibly using information supplied when the IETF network slice
   service was requested.  It also instructs the edge points how to mark
   the packets so that the network routers will know which policies and
   routing instructions to apply.

3.8.  Network Slice-Flow Aggregate Relationships

   The following describes the generalization relationships between the
   IETF network slice and different parts of the solution as described
   in Figure 1.

   o A customer may request 1 or more IETF Network Slices.

   o Any given Attachment Circuit (AC) may support the traffic for 1 or
   more IETF Network Slice, but if there is more than one IETF Network
   Slice using a single AC, the IETF Network Slice Service request must
   include enough information to allow the edge nodes to demultiplex the
   traffic for the different IETF Network Slices.

   o By definition, multiple IETF Network Slices may be mapped to a
   single Slice-Flow Aggregate.  However, it is possible for an Slice-
   Flow Aggregate to contain just a single IETF Network Slice.
   Furthermore, a Slice-Flow Aggregate can be planned and preconfigured,
   and may be "empty" having no IETF Network Slices mapped to it.

   o The physical network may be filtered to multiple Policy Filter
   Topologies.  Each such Policy Filter Topology provides a short-cut to
   planning the placement and support of Slice-Flow Aggregate by
   presenting only the subset of links and nodes that meet specific
   criteria.  Note, however, that a network operator does not need to
   derive any Policy Filter Topologies, choosing to operate directly on
   the full physical network.

   o It is anticipated that there may be very many IETF Network Slices
   supported by a network operator over a single physical network.  The
   scaling mechanisms are deployment choices, but it may be that there
   are no more than 1000 Slice-Flow Aggregates supported by a network,
   with each Slice-Flow Aggregate supporting any number of IETF Network
   Slices.

4.  Network Resource Partition Modes

   An NRP Policy can be used to dictate if the network resource
   partitioning of the shared network resources among multiple Slice-
   Flow Aggregates can be achieved:

   a)  in data plane only,

   b)  in control plane only, or

   c)  in both control and data planes.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


4.1.  Data plane Network Resource Partition Mode

   The physical network resources can be partitioned on network devices
   by applying a Per Hop forwarding Behavior (PHB) onto packets that
   traverse the network devices.  In the Diffserv model, a Class
   Selector (CS) is carried in the packet and is used by transit nodes
   to apply the PHB that determines the scheduling treatment and drop
   probability for packets.

   When data plane NRP mode is applied, packets need to be forwarded on
   the specific NRP that supports the Slice-Flow Aggregate to ensure the
   proper forwarding treatment dictated in the NRP Policy is applied
   (refer to Section 5.1 below).  In this case, a Slice-Flow Aggregate
   Selector (SAS) MUST be carried in each packet to identify the Slice-
   Flow Aggregate that it belongs to.

   The ingress node of an NRP domain, in addition to marking packets
   with a Diffserv CS, MAY also add an SAS to each Slice-Flow Aggregate
   packet.  The transit nodes within an NRP domain MAY use the SAS to
   associate packets with a Slice-Flow Aggregate and to determine the
   Network Resource Partition Per Hop Behavior (NRP-PHB) that is applied
   to the packet (refer to Section 5.1.3 for further details).  The CS
   MAY be used to apply a Diffserv PHB on to the packet to allow
   differentiation of traffic treatment within the same Slice-Flow
   Aggregate.

   When data plane only NRP mode is used, routers may rely on a network
   state independent view of the topology to determine the best paths to
   reach destinations.  In this case, the best path selection dictates
   the forwarding path of packets to the destination.  The SAS field
   carried in each packet determines the specific NRP-PHB treatment
   along the selected path.

   For example, the Segment-Routing Flexible Algorithm
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo] may be deployed in a network to steer
   packets on the IGP computed lowest cumulative delay path.  An NRP
   Policy may be used to allow links along the least latency path to
   share its data plane resources amongst multiple Slice-Flow
   Aggregates.  In this case, the packets that are steered on a specific
   NRP carry the SAS that enables routers (along with the Diffserv CS)
   to determine the NRP-PHB to enforce on the Slice-Flow Aggregate
   traffic streams.

4.2.  Control Plane Network Resource Partition Mode

   Multiple NRPs can be realized over the same set of physical
   resources.  It is possible in this case to allow the state
   reservations to occur on each NRP.



Saad, et al.               Expires 20 May 2022                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


   The network reservation state for a specific partition can then be
   represented in a topology that may can contain all or a subset of the
   physical network elements (nodes and links).  The logical network
   resources that appear in the topology can reflect a part, whole, or
   in-excess of the physical network resource capacity (e.g., when
   oversubscription is desired).

   For example, the physical link bandwidth can be divided into
   fractions, each dedicated to an NRP that supports a Slice-Flow
   Aggregate.  The topology associated with the NRP supporting a Slice-
   Flow Aggregate can be used by routing protocols, or by the ingress/
   PCE when computing Slice-Flow Aggregate aware TE paths.

   To perform network state dependent path computation in this mode
   (Slice-Flow Aggregate aware TE), the resource reservation on each
   link needs to be Slice-Flow Aggregate aware.  Details of required IGP
   extensions to support SA-TE are described in
   [I-D.bestbar-lsr-slice-aware-te].

   The same physical link may be member of multiple slice policies that
   instantiate different NRPs.  The NRP reservable or utilized bandwidth
   on such a link is updated (and may be advertised) whenever new paths
   are placed in the network.  The NRP reservation state, in this case,
   MAY be maintained on each device or off the device on a resource
   reservation manager that holds reservation states for those links in
   the network.

   Multiple NRPs that support Slice-Flow Aggregates can form a group and
   share the available network resources allocated to each.  In this
   case, a node can update the reservable bandwidth for each NRP to take
   into consideration the available bandwidth from other NRPs in the
   same group.

   For illustration purposes, the diagram below represents bandwidth
   isolation or sharing amongst a group of NRPs.  In Figure 1a, the
   NRPs: NRP1, NRP2, NRP3 and NRP4 are not sharing any bandwidths
   between each other.  In Figure 1b, the NRPs: NRP1 and NRP2 can share
   the available bandwidth portion allocated to each amongst them.
   Similarly, NRP3 and NRP4 can share amongst themselves any available
   bandwidth allocated to them, but they cannot share available
   bandwidth allocated to NRP1 or NRP2.  In both cases, the Max
   Reservable Bandwidth may exceed the actual physical link resource
   capacity to allow for over subscription.

4.3.  Data and Control Plane Network Resource Partition Mode

   In order to support strict guarantees for Slice-Flow Aggregates, the
   network resources can be partitioned in both the control plane and
   data plane.







Saad, et al.               Expires 20 May 2022                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


   The control plane partitioning allows the creation of customized
   topologies per NRP that each supports a Slice-Flow Aggregate.  The
   ingress routers or a Path Computation Engine (PCE) can use the
   customized topologies to determine optimal path placement for
   specific demand flows (Slice-Flow Aggregate aware TE).

   The data plane partitioning provides isolation for Slice-Flow
   Aggregate traffic, and protection when resource contention occurs due
   to bursts of traffic from other Slice-Flow Aggregate traffic that
   traverses the same shared network resource.

5.  Network Resource Partition Instantiation

   A network slice can span multiple technologies and multiple
   administrative domains.  Depending on the network slice customer
   requirements, a network slice can be differentiated from other
   network slices in terms of data, control or management planes.

   The customer of a network slice expresses their intent by specifying
   requirements rather than mechanisms to realize the slice as described
   in Section 3.2.

   The network slice controller consumes the network slice service
   intent and realizes it with an appropriate Network Resource Partition
   Policy (NRP Policy).  Multiple IETF network slices MAY be mapped to
   the same Slice-Flow Aggregate as described in Section 3.3.

   The network wide consistent NRP Policy definition is distributed to
   the devices in the network as shown in Figure 1.  The specification
   of the network slice intent on the northbound interface of the
   controller and the mechanism used to map the network slice to a
   Slice-Flow Aggregate are outside the scope of this document.

5.1.  NRP Policy Definition

   The NRP Policy is network-wide construct that is consumed by network
   devices, and may include rules that control the following:

   *  Data plane specific policies: This includes the SAS, any firewall
      rules or flow-spec filters, and QoS profiles associated with the
      NRP Policy and any classes within it.

   *  Control plane specific policies: This includes guaranteed
      bandwidth, any network resource sharing amongst slice policies,
      and reservation preference to prioritize any reservations of a
      specific NRP over others.





Saad, et al.               Expires 20 May 2022                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


   *  Topology membership policies: This defines the topology filter
      policies that dictate node/link/function membership to a specific
      NRP.

   There is a desire for flexibility in realizing network slices to
   support the services across networks consisting of products from
   multiple vendors.  These networks may also be grouped into disparate
   domains and deploy various path control technologies and tunnel
   techniques to carry traffic across the network.  It is expected that
   a standardized data model for NRP Policy will facilitate the
   instantiation and management of the NRP on the topological elements
   selected by the NRP Policy topology filter.  A YANG data model for
   the Network Resource Partition Policy instantiation on the controller
   and network devices is described in
   [I-D.bestbar-teas-yang-slice-policy].

   It is also possible to distribute the NRP Policy to network devices
   using several mechanisms, including protocols such as NETCONF or
   RESTCONF, or exchanging it using a suitable routing protocol that
   network devices participate in (such as IGP(s) or BGP).  The
   extensions to enable specific protocols to carry an NRP Policy
   definition will be described in separate documents.

5.1.1.  Network Resource Partition Data Plane Selector

   A router MUST be able to identify a packet belonging to a Slice-Flow
   Aggregate before it can apply the associated forwarding treatment or
   NRP-PHB.  One or more fields within the packet MAY be used as an SAS
   to do this.

   Forwarding Address Based Selector:

      It is possible to assign a different forwarding address (or MPLS
      forwarding label in case of MPLS network) for each Slice-Flow
      Aggregate on a specific node in the network.  [RFC3031] states in
      Section 2.1 that: 'Some routers analyze a packet's network layer
      header not merely to choose the packet's next hop, but also to
      determine a packet's "precedence" or "class of service"'.
      Assigning a unique forwarding address (or MPLS forwarding label)
      to each Slice-Flow Aggregate allows Slice-Flow Aggregate packets
      destined to a node to be distinguished by the destination address
      (or MPLS forwarding label) that is carried in the packet.

      This approach requires maintaining per Slice-Flow Aggregate state
      for each destination in the network in both the control and data
      plane and on each router in the network.  For example, consider a
      network slicing provider with a network composed of 'N' nodes,
      each with 'K' adjacencies to its neighbors.  Assuming a node can



Saad, et al.               Expires 20 May 2022                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


      be reached over 'M' different Slice-Flow Aggregates, the node
      assigns and advertises reachability to 'N' unique forwarding
      addresses, or MPLS forwarding labels.  Similarly, each node
      assigns a unique forwarding address (or MPLS forwarding label) for
      each of its 'K' adjacencies to enable strict steering over the
      adjacency for each slice.  The total number of control and data
      plane states that need to be stored and programmed in a router's
      forwarding is (N+K)*M states.  Hence, as 'N', 'K', and 'M'
      parameters increase, this approach suffers from scalability
      challenges in both the control and data planes.

   Global Identifier Based Selector:

      An NRP Policy MAY include a Global Identifier SAS (GISS) field as
      defined in [I-D.kompella-mpls-mspl4fa] that is carried in each
      packet in order to associate it to the NRP supporting a Slice-Flow
      Aggregate, independent of the forwarding address or MPLS
      forwarding label that is bound to the destination.  Routers within
      the NRP domain can use the forwarding address (or MPLS forwarding
      label) to determine the forwarding next-hop(s), and use the GISS
      field in the packet to infer the specific forwarding treatment
      that needs to be applied on the packet.

      The GISS can be carried in one of multiple fields within the
      packet, depending on the dataplane used.  For example, in MPLS
      networks, the GISS can be encoded within an MPLS label that is
      carried in the packet's MPLS label stack.  All packets that belong
      to the same Slice-Flow Aggregate MAY carry the same GISS in the
      MPLS label stack.  It is also possible to have multiple GISS's map
      to the same Slice-Flow Aggregate.

      The GISS can be encoded in an MPLS label and may appear in several
      positions in the MPLS label stack.  For example, the VPN service
      label may act as a GISS to allow VPN packets to be mapped to the
      Slice-Flow Aggregate.  In this case, a single VPN service label
      acting as a GISS MAY be allocated by all Egress PEs of a VPN.
      Alternatively, multiple VPN service labels MAY act as GISS's that
      map a single VPN to the same Slice-Flow Aggregate to allow for
      multiple Egress PEs to allocate different VPN service labels for a
      VPN.  In other cases, a range of VPN service labels acting as
      multiple GISS's MAY map multiple VPN traffic to a single Slice-
      Flow Aggregate.  An example of such deployment is shown in
      Figure 3.

           Figure 3: GISS or VPN label at bottom of label stack.

      In some cases, the position of the GISS may not be at a fixed
      position in the MPLS label header.  In this case, the GISS label
      can show up in any position in the MPLS label stack.  To enable a
      transit router to identify the position of the GISS label, a
      special purpose label (ideally a base special purpose label
      (bSPL)) can be used to indicate the presence of a GISS in the MPLS
      label stack.  [I-D.kompella-mpls-mspl4fa] proposes a new bSPL
      called Forwarding Actions Identifier (FAI) that is assigned to
      alert of the presence of multiple actions and action data
      (including the presence of the GISS).  The NRP ingress boundary
      node, in this case, imposes two labels: the FAI label and a
      forwarding actions label that includes the GISS to identify the
      Slice-Flow Aggregate packets as shown in Figure 4.

      [I-D.decraene-mpls-slid-encoded-entropy-label-id] also proposes to
      repurpose the ELI/EL [RFC6790] to carry the Slice Identifier in
      order to minimize the size of the MPLS stack and ease incremental
      deployment.

      When the slice is realized over an IP dataplane, the GISS can be
      encoded in the IP header.  For example, the GISS can be encoded in
      portion of the IPv6 Flow Label field as described in
      [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-stateless-slice-id].

5.1.2.  Network Resource Partition Resource Reservation

   Bandwidth and network resource allocation strategies for slice
   policies are essential to achieve optimal placement of paths within
   the network while still meeting the target SLOs.

   Resource reservation allows for the managing of available bandwidth
   and for prioritization of existing allocations to enable preference-
   based preemption when contention on a specific network resource
   arises.  Sharing of a network resource's available bandwidth amongst
   a group of NRPs may also be desirable.  For example, a Slice-Flow
   Aggregate may not be using all of the NRP reservable bandwidth; this
   allows other NRPs in the same group to use the available bandwidth
   resources for other Slice-Flow Aggregates.





Saad, et al.               Expires 20 May 2022                 [Page 19]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


   Congestion on shared network resources may result from sub-optimal
   placement of paths in different slice policies.  When this occurs,
   preemption of some Slice-Flow Aggregate paths may be desirable to
   alleviate congestion.  A preference based allocation scheme enables
   prioritization of Slice-Flow Aggregate paths that can be preempted.

   Since network characteristics and its state can change over time, the
   NRP topology and its network state need to be propagated in the
   network to enable ingress TE routers or Path Computation Engine
   (PCEs) to perform accurate path placement based on the current state
   of the NRP network resources.

5.1.3.  Network Resource Partition Per Hop Behavior

   In Diffserv terminology, the forwarding behavior that is assigned to
   a specific class is called a Per Hop Behavior (PHB).  The PHB defines
   the forwarding precedence that a marked packet with a specific CS
   receives in relation to other traffic on the Diffserv-aware network.

   The NRP Per Hop Behavior (NRP-PHB) is the externally observable
   forwarding behavior applied to a specific packet belonging to a
   Slice-Flow Aggregate.  The goal of an NRP-PHB is to provide a
   specified amount of network resources for traffic belonging to a
   specific Slice-Flow Aggregate.  A single NRP may also support
   multiple forwarding treatments or services that can be carried over
   the same logical network.

   The Slice-Flow Aggregate traffic may be identified at NRP ingress
   boundary nodes by carrying a SAS to allow routers to apply a specific
   forwarding treatment that guarantee the SLA(s).

   With Differentiated Services (Diffserv) it is possible to carry
   multiple services over a single converged network.  Packets requiring
   the same forwarding treatment are marked with a Class Selector (CS)
   at domain ingress nodes.  Up to eight classes or Behavior Aggregates
   (BAs) may be supported for a given Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)
   [RFC2475].  To support multiple forwarding treatments over the same
   Slice-Flow Aggregate, a Slice-Flow Aggregate packet MAY also carry a
   Diffserv CS to identify the specific Diffserv forwarding treatment to
   be applied on the traffic belonging to the same NRP.

   At transit nodes, the CS field carried inside the packets are used to
   determine the specific PHB that determines the forwarding and
   scheduling treatment before packets are forwarded, and in some cases,
   drop probability for each packet.

5.1.4.  Network Resource Partition Topology

   A key element of the NRP Policy is a customized topology that may
   include the full or subset of the physical network topology.  The NRP
   topology could also span multiple administrative domains and/or
   multiple dataplane technologies.

   An NRP topology can overlap or share a subset of links with another
   NRP topology.  A number of topology filtering policies can be defined
   as part of the NRP Policy to limit the specific topology elements
   that belong to the NRP.  For example, a topology filtering policy can
   leverage Resource Affinities as defined in [RFC2702] to include or
   exclude certain links that the NRP is instantiated on in supports of
   the Slice-Flow Aggregate.

   The NRP Policy may also include a reference to a predefined topology
   (e.g., derived from a Flexible Algorithm Definition (FAD) as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo], or Multi-Topology ID as defined
   [RFC4915].  A YANG data model that covers generic topology filters is
   described in [I-D.bestbar-teas-yang-topology-filter].  Also, the Path
   Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions to
   carry topology filters are defined in [I-D.xpbs-pce-topology-filter].

5.2.  Network Resource Partition Boundary

   A network slice originates at the edge nodes of a network slice
   provider.  Traffic that is steered over the corresponding NRP
   supporting a Slice-Flow Aggregate may traverse NRP capable as well as
   NRP incapable interior nodes.

   The network slice may encompass one or more domains administered by a
   provider.  For example, an organization's intranet or an ISP.  The
   network provider is responsible for ensuring that adequate network
   resources are provisioned and/or reserved to support the SLAs offered
   by the network end-to-end.

5.2.1.  Network Resource Partition Edge Nodes

   NRP edge nodes sit at the boundary of a network slice provider
   network and receive traffic that requires steering over network
   resources specific to a NRP that supports a Slice-Flow Aggregate.
   These edge nodes are responsible for identifying Slice-Flow Aggregate
   specific traffic flows by possibly inspecting multiple fields from
   inbound packets (e.g., implementations may inspect IP traffic's
   network 5-tuple in the IP and transport protocol headers) to decide
   on which NRP it can be steered.





Saad, et al.               Expires 20 May 2022                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


   Network slice ingress nodes may condition the inbound traffic at
   network boundaries in accordance with the requirements or rules of
   each service's SLAs.  The requirements and rules for network slice
   services are set using mechanisms which are outside the scope of this
   document.

   When data plane NRP mode is employed, the NRP ingress nodes are
   responsible for adding a suitable SAS onto packets that belong to
   specific Slice-Flow Aggregate.  In addition, edge nodes MAY mark the
   corresponding Diffserv CS to differentiate between different types of
   traffic carried over the same Slice-Flow Aggregate.

5.2.2.  Network Resource Partition Interior Nodes

   An NRP interior node receives slice traffic and MAY be able to
   identify the packets belonging to a specific Slice-Flow Aggregate by
   inspecting the SAS field carried inside each packet, or by inspecting
   other fields within the packet that may identify the traffic streams
   that belong to a specific Slice-Flow Aggregate.  For example, when
   data plane NRP mode is applied, interior nodes can use the SAS
   carried within the packet to apply the corresponding NRP-PHB
   forwarding behavior.  Nodes within the network slice provider network
   may also inspect the Diffserv CS within each packet to apply a per
   Diffserv class PHB within the NRP Policy, and allow differentiation
   of forwarding treatments for packets forwarded over the same NRP that
   supports the Slice-Flow Aggregate.

5.2.3.  Network Resource Partition Incapable Nodes

   Packets that belong to a Slice-Flow Aggregate may need to traverse
   nodes that are NRP incapable.  In this case, several options are
   possible to allow the slice traffic to continue to be forwarded over
   such devices and be able to resume the NRP forwarding treatment once
   the traffic reaches devices that are NRP capable.

   When data plane NRP mode is employed, packets carry a SAS to allow
   slice interior nodes to identify them.  To enable end-to-end network
   slicing, the SAS MUST be maintained in the packets as they traverse
   devices within the network - including NRP incapable devices.

   For example, when the SAS is an MPLS label at the bottom of the MPLS
   label stack, packets can traverse over devices that are NRP incapable
   without any further considerations.  On the other hand when the SASL
   is at the top of the MPLS label stack, packets can be bypassed (or
   tunneled) over the NRP incapable devices towards the next device that
   supports NRP as shown in Figure 5.

5.2.4.  Combining Network Resource Partition Modes

   It is possible to employ a combination of the NRP modes that were
   discussed in Section 4 to realize a network slice.  For example, data
   and control plane NRP modes can be employed in parts of a network,
   while control plane NRP mode can be employed in the other parts of
   the network.  The path selection, in such case, can take into account
   the NRP available network resources.  The SAS carried within packets
   allow transit nodes to enforce the corresponding NRP-PHB on the parts
   of the network that apply the data plane NRP mode.  The SAS can be
   maintained while traffic traverses nodes that do not enforce data
   plane NRP mode, and so slice PHB enforcement can resume once traffic
   traverses capable nodes.

5.3.  Mapping Traffic on Slice-Flow Aggregates

   The usual techniques to steer traffic onto paths can be applicable
   when steering traffic over paths established for a specific Slice-
   Flow Aggregate.

   For example, one or more (layer-2 or layer-3) VPN services can be
   directly mapped to paths established for a Slice-Flow Aggregate.  In
   this case, the per Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance
   traffic that arrives on the Provider Edge (PE) router over external
   interfaces can be directly mapped to a specific Slice-Flow Aggregate
   path.  External interfaces can be further partitioned (e.g., using
   VLANs) to allow mapping one or more VLANs to specific Slice-Flow
   Aggregate paths.

   Another option is steer traffic to specific destinations directly
   over multiple slice policies.  This allows traffic arriving on any
   external interface and targeted to such destinations to be directly
   steered over the slice paths.

   A third option that can also be used is to utilize a data plane
   firewall filter or classifier to enable matching of several fields in
   the incoming packets to decide whether the packet belongs to a
   specific Slice-Flow Aggregate.  This option allows for applying a
   rich set of rules to identify specific packets to be mapped to a
   Slice-Flow Aggregate.  However, it requires data plane network
   resources to be able to perform the additional checks in hardware.

6.  Path Selection and Instantiation

6.1.  Applicability of Path Selection to Slice-Flow Aggregates

   The path selection in the network can be network state dependent, or
   network state independent as described in Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis].  The latter is the choice commonly used
   by IGPs when selecting a best path to a destination prefix, while the
   former is used by ingress TE routers, or Path Computation Engines
   (PCEs) when optimizing the placement of a flow based on the current
   network resource utilization.

   When path selection is network state dependent, the path computation
   can leverage Traffic Engineering mechanisms (e.g., as defined in
   [RFC2702]) to compute feasible paths taking into account the incoming
   traffic demand rate and current state of network.  This allows
   avoiding overly utilized links, and reduces the chance of congestion
   on traversed links.





Saad, et al.               Expires 20 May 2022                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


   To enable TE path placement, the link state is advertised with
   current reservations, thereby reflecting the available bandwidth on
   each link.  Such link reservations may be maintained centrally on a
   network wide network resource manager, or distributed on devices (as
   usually done with RSVP).  TE extensions exist today to allow IGPs
   (e.g., [RFC3630] and [RFC5305]), and BGP-LS [RFC7752] to advertise
   such link state reservations.

   When the network resource reservations are maintained for NRPs, the
   link state can carry per NRP state (e.g., reservable bandwidth).
   This allows path computation to take into account the specific
   network resources available for an NRP.  In this case, we refer to
   the process of path placement and path provisioning as Slice-Flow
   Aggregate aware TE.

6.2.  Applicability of Path Control Technologies to Slice-Flow
      Aggregates

   The NRP modes described in this document are agnostic to the
   technology used to setup paths that carry Slice-Flow Aggregate
   traffic.  One or more paths connecting the endpoints of the mapped
   IETF network slices may be selected to steer the corresponding
   traffic streams over the resources allocated for the NRP that
   supports a Slice-Flow Aggregate.

   The feasible paths can be computed using the NRP topology and network
   state subject the optimization metrics and constraints.

6.2.1.  RSVP-TE Based Slice-Flow Aggregate Paths

   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] can be used to signal LSPs over the computed
   feasible paths in order to carry the Slice-Flow Aggregate traffic.
   The specific extensions to the RSVP-TE protocol required to enable
   signaling of Slice-Flow Aggregate aware RSVP LSPs are outside the
   scope of this document.

6.2.2.  SR Based Slice-Flow Aggregate Paths

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] can be used to setup and steer traffic
   over the computed Slice-Flow Aggregate feasible paths.

   The SR architecture defines a number of building blocks that can be
   leveraged to support the realization of NRPs that support Slice-Flow
   Aggregates in an SR network.

   Such building blocks include:

   *  SR Policy with or without Flexible Algorithm.



Saad, et al.               Expires 20 May 2022                 [Page 25]

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing           November 2021


   *  Steering of services (e.g.  VPN) traffic over SR paths

   *  SR Operation, Administration and Management (OAM) and Performance
      Management (PM)

   SR allows a headend node to steer packets onto specific SR paths
   using a Segment Routing Policy (SR Policy).  The SR policy supports
   various optimization objectives and constraints and can be used to
   steer Slice-Flow Aggregate traffic in the SR network.

   The SR policy can be instantiated with or without the IGP Flexible
   Algorithm (Flex-Algorithm) feature.  It may be possible to dedicate a
   single SR Flex-Algorithm to compute and instantiate SR paths for one
   Slice-Flow Aggregate traffic.  In this case, the SR Flex-Algorithm
   computed paths and Flex-Algorithm SR SIDs are not shared by other
   Slice-Flow Aggregates traffic.  However, to allow for better scale,
   it may be desirable for multiple Slice-Flow Aggregates traffic to
   share the same SR Flex-Algorithm computed paths and SIDs.  Further
   details on how the NRP modes presented in this document can be
   realized in an SR network are discussed in
   [I-D.bestbar-spring-scalable-ns], and [I-D.bestbar-lsr-spring-sa].

7.  Network Resource Partition Protocol Extensions

   Routing protocols may need to be extended to carry additional per NRP
   link state.  For example, [RFC5305], [RFC3630], and [RFC7752] are
   ISIS, OSPF, and BGP protocol extensions to exchange network link
   state information to allow ingress TE routers and PCE(s) to do proper
   path placement in the network.  The extensions required to support
   network slicing may be defined in other documents, and are outside
   the scope of this document.

   The instantiation of an NRP Policy may need to be automated.
   Multiple options are possible to facilitate automation of
   distribution of an NRP Policy to capable devices.

   For example, a YANG data model for the NRP Policy may be supported on
   network devices and controllers.  A suitable transport (e.g., NETCONF
   [RFC6241], RESTCONF [RFC8040], or gRPC) may be used to enable
   configuration and retrieval of state information for slice policies
   on network devices.  The NRP Policy YANG data model is outside the
   scope of this document, and is defined in
   [I-D.bestbar-teas-yang-slice-policy].

9.  Security Considerations

   The main goal of network slicing is to allow for varying treatment of
   traffic from multiple different network slices that are utilizing a
   common network infrastructure and to allow for different levels of
   services to be provided for traffic traversing a given network
   resource.

   A variety of techniques may be used to achieve this, but the end
   result will be that some packets may be mapped to specific resources
   and may receive different (e.g., better) service treatment than
   others.  The mapping of network traffic to a specific NRP is
   indicated primarily by the SAS, and hence an adversary may be able to
   utilize resources allocated to a specific NRP by injecting packets
   carrying the same SAS field in their packets.

   Such theft-of-service may become a denial-of-service attack when the
   modified or injected traffic depletes the resources available to
   forward legitimate traffic belonging to a specific NRP.

   The defense against this type of theft and denial-of-service attacks
   consists of a combination of traffic conditioning at NRP domain
   boundaries with security and integrity of the network infrastructure
   within an NRP domain.
