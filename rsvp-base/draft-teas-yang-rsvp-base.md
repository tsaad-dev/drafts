--- abstract

This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration and management of
the RSVP protocol. The YANG data model covers the building blocks that may be
augmented by other RSVP extension data models such as RSVP Traffic-Engineering
(RSVP-TE). It is divided into two modules that cover the basic and extended
RSVP features.

# Introduction

YANG {{!RFC6020}} and {{!RFC7950}} is a data modeling language that was
introduced to define the contents of a conceptual data store that allows
networked devices to be managed using NETCONF {{!RFC6241}}. YANG has proved
relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other interfaces (e.g.
RESTCONF {{!RFC8040}}) and encoding other than XML (e.g. JSON) are being defined.
Furthermore, YANG data models can be used as the basis of implementation for
other interfaces, such as CLI and programmatic APIs.

This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration and management of
the RSVP protocol {{?RFC2205}}. The data model is divided into two modules:
a base and extended RSVP YANG modules. The RSVP base YANG 'ietf-rsvp' module covers the
data that is core to the function of the RSVP protocol and MUST be supported by
vendors that support RSVP protocol {{?RFC2205}}.  The RSVP extended 'ietf-rsvp-extended'
module covers the data that is optional, or provides ability to tune
RSVP protocol base functionality. The support for RSVP extended module
features by vendors is considered optional.

The RSVP YANG model provides the building blocks needed to allow augmentation
by other models that extend the RSVP protocol-- such as using RSVP extensions to
signal Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as defined in {{?RFC3209}}.

The YANG module(s) defined in this document are compatible with the Network
Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) {{!RFC7950}}.

# Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in {{!RFC7950}}.

## Prefixes in Data Node Names

In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects are prefixed
using the standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG imported
modules, as shown in Table 1.

   | Prefix    | YANG module        | Reference |
   |-----------|--------------------|-----------|
   | if        | ietf-interfaces    | {{!RFC8343}} |

## Model Tree Diagram

A full tree diagram of the module(s) defined in this document is given in
subsequent sections  as per the syntax defined in {{!RFC8340}}.

# Model Overview

The RSVP YANG module augments the "control-plane-protocol" entry from the
'ietf-routing' module defined in {{!RFC8349}}. It also defines the identity
"rsvp" of base type "rt:routing-protocol" to identify the RSVP routing protocol.

The 'ietf-rsvp' model defines a single instance of the RSVP protocol.  The top
'rsvp' container encompases data for one such RSVP protocol instance.  Multiple
instances can be defined as multiple control-plane protocols instances as
described in {{!RFC8349}}.

The YANG data model defined has the common building blocks for the operation of
the base RSVP protocol for the session type defined in {{?RFC2205}}. The
augmentation of this model by other models (e.g. to support RSVP Traffic
Engineering (TE) extensions for signaling Label Switched Paths (LSPs)) are
outside the scope of this document and are discussed in separate document(s).

## Module(s) Relationship

This RSVP YANG data model defined in this document is divided into two modules: a base and extended
modules. The RSVP data covered in 'ietf-rsvp' module are categorized as core to
the function of the protocol and MUST be supported by vendors claiming the support for RSVP
protocol {{?RFC2205}}.

The RSVP extended features that are covered in 'ietf-rsvp-extended' module are
categorized as either optional or providing ability to better tune the basic
functionality of the RSVP protocol. The support for RSVP extended features by
all vendors is considered optional.

The relationship between the base and RSVP extended YANG modules and the IETF
routing YANG model is shown in {{figctrl}}.

## Core Features {#CoreFeatures}

The RSVP data covered in the 'ietf-rsvp' YANG module provides the common building
blocks that are required to configure, operate and manage the RSVP protocol
and MUST be supported by vendors that claim the support for base RSVP protocol
defined in {{?RFC2205}}.

In addition, the following standard RSVP core features are modeled under the
'ietf-rsvp' module:

* Basic operational statistics, including protocol messages, packets and errors.
* Basic RSVP authentication feature as defined in {{?RFC2747}}) using string
  based authentication key.
* Basic RSVP Refresh Reduction feature as defined in ({{?RFC2961}}).
* Basic RSVP Hellos feature as defined in ({{?RFC3209}})
* Basic RSVP Graceful Restart feature as defined in {{?RFC3473}}, {{?RFC5063}}, and
  {{?RFC5495}}.


## Optional Features {#OptionalFeatures}

Optional features are beyond the basic configuration, and operation of the
RSVP protocol. The decision whether to support these RSVP features on a
particular device is left to the vendor that supports the RSVP core features.

The following optional features that are covered in the 'ietf-rsvp-extended'
YANG module:

* Advanced operational statistics, including protocol messages, packets and errors.
* Advanced RSVP authentication features as defined in {{?RFC2747}}) using various
  authentication key types including those defined in {{!RFC8177}}.
* Advanced RSVP Refresh Reduction features defined in ({{?RFC2961}}).
* Advanced RSVP Hellos features as defined in {{?RFC3209}}, and {{?rfc4558}}.
* Advanced RSVP Graceful Restart features as defined in {{?RFC3473}}, {{?RFC5063}}, and
  {{?RFC5495}}.

## Data Model Structure

The RSVP YANG data model defines the 'rsvp' top-level container that contains
the configuration and operational state for the RSVP protocol.
The presence of this container enables the RSVP protocol functionality.

The 'rsvp' top-level container also includes data that has router level scope
(i.e. applicable to all objects modeled under rsvp). It also contains
configuration and state data about the following types of RSVP objects:

 * interfaces
 * neighbors
 * sessions

The derived state data is contained in "read-only" nodes directly under the
intended object as shown in {{fig-highlevel}}.

~~~~~~~~~~~
module: ietf-rsvp
   +--rw rsvp!
      +--rw <<router-level scope data>>
         .
         .
      +--rw interfaces
            .
            +-- ro <<derived state associated with interfaces>>
         .
         .
      +--rw neighbors
            .
            +-- ro <<derived state associated with the LSP Tunnel>>
         .
         .
      +--rw sessions
            .
            +-- ro <<derived state associated with the LSP Tunnel>>
         .
   rpcs:
      +--x clear-session
      +--x clear-neighbor
      +--x clear-authentication

~~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-highlevel title="RSVP high-level tree model view"}

The following 

    
'router-level':

> The router-level scope configuration and state data are applicable to all
> modeled objects under the top-level 'rsvp' container, and MAY affect the RSVP
> protocol behavior.

'interfaces':

> The 'interfaces' container includes a list of RSVP enabled interfaces. It
> also includes RSVP configuration and state data that is applicable to all
> interfaces.  An entry in the interfaces list MAY carry its own configuration
> or state data. Any data or state under the "interfaces" container level is
> equally applicable to all interfaces unless it is explicitly overridden by
> configuration or state under a specific interface.

'neighbors' :

> The 'neighbors' container includes a list of RSVP neighbors. An entry in the
> RSVP neighbor list MAY carry its own configuration and state relevant to the
> specific RSVP neighbor. The RSVP neighbors can be dynamically discovered using
> RSVP signaling, or can be explicitly configured.

'sessions':

> The 'sessions' container includes a list RSVP sessions. An entry in the RSVP
> session list MAY carry its own configuration and state relevant to a specific
> RSVP session. RSVP sessions are usually derived state that are created as
> result of signaling. This model defines attributes related to IP RSVP
> sessions as defined in {{?RFC2205}}.

The defined YANG data model supports configuration inheritance for neighbors, and
interfaces.  Data nodes defined under the main container (e.g. the container
that encompasses the list of interfaces, or neighbors) are assumed to apply
equally to all elements of the list, unless overridden explicitly for a certain
element (e.g. interface).

## Model Notifications

Modeling notifications data is key in any defined YANG data model. {{!RFC8639}} and
{{!RFC8641}} define a subscription and push mechanism for YANG datastores. This
mechanism currently allows the user to:

- Subscribe notifications on a per client basis
- Specify subtree filters {{!RFC6241}} or XPath filters {{!RFC8639}} so that only interested
  contents will be sent.
- Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

# RSVP Base YANG Model

The RSVP base module includes the core features and building blocks for modeling the RSVP
protocol as described in {{CoreFeatures}}.

# Security Considerations

The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data that is
designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF
{{!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{!RFC8040}}. The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
Shell (SSH) {{!RFC6242}}.  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS {{!RFC8446}}.

The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{!RFC8341}} provides the
means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations
and content.

There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module(s) defined in this
document that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
network environments.  Write operations (e.g., \<edit-config\>) to these data
nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

/rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol/rsvp:rsvp/
    /rsvp:globals
    /rsvp:interfaces
    /rsvp:sessions

> All of which are considered sensitive and if access to either of these is
> compromised, it can result in temporary network outages or be employed to
> mount DoS attacks.

Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered sensitive
or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to these data nodes.
These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

/rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol/rsvp:rsvp/
    /rsvp:globals
    /rsvp:interfaces
    /rsvp:sessions

> Additional information from these state data nodes can be inferred with respect
> to the network topology, and device location and subsequently be used to mount
> other attacks in the network.

For RSVP authentication, the configuration supported is via the specification of
key-chains {{!RFC8177}} or the direct specification of key and authentication
algorithm, and hence security considerations of {{!RFC8177}} are inherited.  This
includes the considerations with respect to the local storage and handling of
authentication keys.

Some of the RPC operations defined in this YANG module may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
important to control access to these operations.  The RSVP YANG
module support the "clear-session" and "clear-neighbor" RPCs.  If
access to either of these is compromised, they can result in
temporary network outages be employed to mount DoS attacks.

The security considerations spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification
{{!RFC7950}} apply for this document as well.
