A YANG Data Model for Traffic Engineering Tunnels, Label Switched Paths
                             and Interfaces
                       draft-ietf-teas-yang-te-29

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for the provisioning and
   management of Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels, Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), and interfaces.  The model is divided into YANG modules that
   classify data into generic, device-specific, technology agnostic, and
   technology-specific elements.

   This model covers data for configuration, operational state, remote
   procedural calls, and event notifications.

1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] and [RFC7950] is a data modeling language that was
   introduced to define the contents of a conceptual data store that
   allows networked devices to be managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG
   has proved relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other
   interfaces (e.g.  RESTCONF [RFC8040]) and encoding other than XML
   (e.g.  JSON) are being defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be
   used as the basis of implementation for other interfaces, such as CLI
   and programmatic APIs.

   This document describes YANG data model for Traffic Engineering (TE)
   tunnels, Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and interfaces.  The model
   covers data applicable to generic or device-independent, device-
   specific, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) technology
   specific.

   The document describes a high-level relationship between the modules
   defined in this document, as well as other external protocol YANG
   modules.  The TE generic YANG data model does not include any data
   specific to a signaling protocol.  It is expected other data plane
   technology model(s) will augment the TE generic YANG data model.

   Also, it is expected other YANG module(s) that model TE signaling
   protocols, such as RSVP-TE ([RFC3209], [RFC3473]), or Segment-Routing
   TE (SR-TE) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] will augment the
   generic TE YANG module.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are used in this
   specification:

   *  client

   *  configuration data

   *  state data

   This document also makes use of the following terminology introduced
   in the YANG Data Modeling Language [RFC7950]:

   *  augment

   *  data model

   *  data node

2.1.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

3.  Design Considerations

   This document describes a generic TE YANG data model that is
   independent of any dataplane technology.  One of the design
   objectives is to allow specific data plane technology models to reuse
   the TE generic data model and possibly augment it with technology
   specific data.

   The elements of the generic TE YANG data model, including TE Tunnels,
   LSPs, and interfaces have leaf(s) that identify the technology layer
   where they reside.  For example, the LSP encoding type can identify
   the technology associated with a TE Tunnel or LSP.

   Also, the generic TE YANG data model does not cover signaling
   protocol data.  The signaling protocol used to instantiate TE LSPs
   are outside the scope of this document and expected to be covered by
   augmentations defined in other document(s).

   The following other design considerations are taken into account with
   respect data organization:

   *  The generic TE YANG data model 'ietf-te' contains device
      independent data and can be used to model data off a device (e.g.
      on a TE controller).  The device-specific TE data is defined in
      module 'ietf-te-device' as shown in Figure 1,

   *  In general, minimal elements in the model are designated as
      "mandatory" to allow freedom to vendors to adapt the data model to
      their specific product implementation.

   *  Suitable defaults are specified for all configurable elements.

   *  The model declares a number of TE functions as features that can
      be optionally supported.

3.1.  State Data Organization

   The Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342]
   addresses modeling state data for ephemeral objects.  This document
   adopts the NMDA model for configuration and state data representation
   as per IETF guidelines for new IETF YANG models.

4.  Model Overview

   The data models defined in this document cover the core TE features
   that are commonly supported by different vendor implementations.  The
   support of extended or vendor specific TE feature(s) is expected to
   be in either augmentations, or deviations to the model defined in
   this document.

4.1.  Module Relationship

   The generic TE YANG data model that is defined in "ietf-te.yang"
   covers the building blocks that are device independent and agnostic
   of any specific technology or control plane instances.  The TE device
   model defined in "ietf-te-device.yang" augments the generic TE YANG
   data model and covers data that is specific to a device - for
   example, attributes of TE interfaces, or TE timers that are local to
   a TE node.

   The TE data model for specific instances of data plane technology
   exist in a separate YANG module(s) that augment the generic TE YANG
   data model.  For example, the MPLS-TE module "ietf-te-mpls.yang" is
   defined in another document and augments the TE generic model as
   shown in Figure 1.

   The TE data model for specific instances of signaling protocol are
   outside the scope of this document and are defined in other
   documents.  For example, the RSVP-TE YANG model augmentation of the
   TE model is covered in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-rsvp].

5.  TE YANG Model

   The generic TE YANG module ('ietf-te') is meant to manage and operate
   a TE network.  This includes creating, modifying and retrieving TE
   Tunnels, LSPs, and interfaces and their associated attributes (e.g.
   Administrative-Groups, SRLGs, etc.).

   The detailed tree structure is provided in Figure 2.

5.1.  Module Structure

   The 'ietf-te' uses three main containers grouped under the main 'te'
   container (see Figure 2).  The 'te' container is the top level
   container in the data model.  The presence of the 'te' container
   enables TE function system wide.  Below provides further descriptions
   of containers that exist under the 'te' top level container.

   globals:

      The 'globals' container maintains the set of global TE attributes
      that can be applicable to TE Tunnel(s) and interface(s).

   tunnels:

      The 'tunnels' container includes the list of TE Tunnels that are
      instantiated.  Refer to Section 5.1.2 for further details on the
      properties of a TE Tunnel.

   lsps:

      The 'lsps' container includes the list of TE LSP(s) that are
      instantiated for TE Tunnels.  Refer to Section 5.1.3 for further
      details on the properties of a TE LSP.

   tunnels-path-compute:

      A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to request path computation for a
      specific TE Tunnel.  The RPC allows requesting path computation
      using atomic and stateless operation.  A tunnel may also be
      configured in 'compute-only' mode to provide stateful path updates
      - see Section 5.1.2 for further details.

   tunnels-action:

      An RPC to request a specific action (e.g. reoptimize, or tear-and-
      setup) to be taken on a specific tunnel or all tunnels.

5.1.1.  TE Globals

   The 'globals' container covers properties that control TE features
   behavior system-wide, and its respective state (see Figure 3).  The
   TE globals configuration include:

        +--rw globals
        |  +--rw named-admin-groups
        |  |  +--rw named-admin-group* [name]

   named-admin-groups:

      A YANG container for the list of named (extended) administrative
      groups that may be applied to TE links.

   named-srlgs:

      A YANG container for the list named Shared Risk Link Groups
      (SRLGs) that may be applied to TE links.

   named-path-constraints:

      A YANG container for a list of named path constraints.  Each named
      path constraint is composed of a set of constraints that can be
      applied during path computation.  A named path constraint can be
      applied to multiple TE Tunnels.  Path constraints may also be
      specified directly under the TE Tunnel.  The path constraint
      specified under the TE Tunnel take precedence over the path
      constraints derived from the referenced named path constraint.  A
      named path constraint entry can be formed up of the following path
      constraints:

            of affinity values and mask to be used during path
            computation.

         o  path-affinity-names: A YANG container that holds the set of
            named affinity constraints and corresponding inclusion or
            exclusions instruction for each to be used during path
            computation.

         o  path-srlgs-lists: A YANG container that holds the set of
            SRLG values and corresponding inclusion or exclusions
            instruction to be used during path computation.

         o  path-srlgs-names: A YANG container that holds the set of
            named SRLG constraints and corresponding inclusion or
            exclusions instruction for each to be used during path
            computation.

         o  disjointness: The level of resource disjointness constraint
            that the secondary path of a TE tunnel has to adhere to.

         o  explicit-route-objects-always: A YANG container that
            contains two route objects lists:

            +  'route-object-exclude-always': a list of route entries to
               always exclude from the path computation.

            +  'route-object-include-exclude': a list of route entries
               to include or exclude in the path computation.

         The 'route-object-include-exclude' is used to configure
         constraints on which route objects (e.g., nodes, links) are
         included or excluded in the path computation.

         The interpretation of an empty 'route-object-include-exclude'
         list depends on the TE Tunnel (end-to-end or Tunnel Segment)
         and on the specific path, according to the following rules:

         1.  An empty 'route-object-include-exclude' list for the
             primary path of an end-to-end TE Tunnel indicates that
             there are no route objects to be included or excluded in
             the path computation.

         2.  An empty 'route-object-include-exclude' list for the
             primary path of a TE Tunnel Segment indicates that no
             primary LSP is required for that TE Tunnel.

         3.  An empty 'route-object-include-exclude' list for a reverse
             path means it always follows the forward path (i.e., the TE
             Tunnel is co-routed).  When the 'route-object-include-
             exclude' list is not empty, the reverse path is routed
             independently of the forward path.

         4.  An empty 'route-object-include-exclude' list for the
             secondary (forward) path indicates that the secondary path
             has the same endpoints as the primary path.

5.1.2.  TE Tunnels

   The 'tunnels' container holds the list of TE Tunnels that are
   provisioned on devices in the network (see Figure 5).

   A TE Tunnel in the list is uniquely identified by a name.  When the
   model is used to manage a specific device, the 'tunnels' list
   contains the TE Tunnels originating from the specific device.  When
   the model is used to manage a TE controller, the 'tunnels' list
   contains all TE Tunnels and TE tunnel segments originating from
   device(s) that the TE controller manages.

   The TE Tunnel model allows the configuration and management of the
   following TE tunnel related objected:

   TE Tunnel:

      A YANG container of one or more LSPs established between the
      source and destination TE Tunnel termination points.  A TE Tunnel
      LSP is a connection-oriented service provided by the network layer
      for the delivery of client data between a source and the
      destination of the TE Tunnel termination points.

   TE Tunnel Segment:

      A part of a multi-domain TE Tunnel that is within a specific
      network domain.

   The TE Tunnel has a number of attributes that are set directly under
   the tunnel (see Figure 5).  The main attributes of a TE Tunnel are
   described below:

   operational-state:

      A YANG leaf that holds the operational state of the tunnel.

   name:

      A YANG leaf that holds the name of a TE Tunnel.  The name of the
      TE Tunnel uniquely identifies the tunnel within the TE tunnel
      list.  The name of the TE Tunnel can be formatted as a Uniform

      Resource Indicator (URI) by including the namespace to ensure
      uniqueness of the name amongst all the TE Tunnels present on
      devices and controllers.

   alias:

      A YANG leaf that holds an alternate name to the TE tunnel.  Unlike
      the TE tunnel name, the alias can be modified at any time during
      the lifetime of the TE tunnel.

   identifier:

      A YANG leaf that holds an identifier of the tunnel.  This
      identifier is unique amongst tunnels originated from the same
      ingress device.

   color:

      A YANG leaf that holds the color associated with the TE tunnel.
      The color is used to map or steer services that carry matching
      color on to the TE tunnel as described in [RFC9012].

   encoding/switching:

      The 'encoding' and 'switching-type' are YANG leafs that define the
      specific technology in which the tunnel operates in as described
      in [RFC3945].

   reoptimize-timer:

      A YANG leaf to set the inteval period for tunnel reoptimization.

   source/destination:

      YANG leafs that define the tunnel source and destination node
      endpoints.

   src-tunnel-tp-id/dst-tunnel-tp-id:

      YANG leafs that hold the identifiers of source and destination TE
      Tunnel Termination Points (TTPs) [RFC8795] residing on the source
      and destination nodes.  The TTP identifiers are optional on nodes
      that have a single TTP per node.  For example, TTP identifiers are
      optional for packet (IP/MPLS) routers.

      external TE controller that may initiate or control a tunnel.
      This target node may be augmented by external module(s), for
      example, to add data for PCEP initiated and/or delegated tunnels.

   bidirectional:

   hierarchy:

      A YANG container that holds hierarchy related properties of the TE
      Tunnel (see Figure 6.  A TE LSP can be set up in MPLS or
      Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks to be used as a TE links to
      carry traffic in other (client) networks [RFC6107].  In this case,
      the model introduces the TE Tunnel hierarchical link endpoint
      parameters to identify the specific link in the client layer that
      the underlying TE Tunnel is associated with.  The hierarchy
      container includes the following:

         o  dependency-tunnels: A set of hierarchical TE Tunnels
            provisioned or to be provisioned in the immediate lower
            layer that this TE tunnel depends on for multi-layer path
            computation.  A dependency TE Tunnel is provisioned if and
            only if it is used (selected by path computation) at least
            by one client layer TE Tunnel.  The TE link in the client
            layer network topology supported by a dependent TE Tunnel is
            dynamically created only when the dependency TE Tunnel is
            actually provisioned.

         o  hierarchical-link: A YANG container that holds the identity
            of the hierarchical link (in the client layer) that is
            supported by this TE Tunnel.  The endpoints of the
            hierarchical link are defined by TE tunnel source and
            destination node endpoints.  The hierarchical link can be
            identified by its source and destination link termination
            point identifiers.

5.1.2.1.  TE Tunnel Paths

   The TE Tunnel can be configured with a set of paths that define the
   tunnel forward and reverse paths as described in Figure 7.  Moreover,
   a primary path can be specified a set of candidate secondary paths
   that can be visited to support path protection.  The following
   describe further the list of paths associated with a TE Tunnel.

               Figure 7: TE Tunnel paths YANG tree structure

   primary-paths:

      A YANG container that holds the list of primary paths.  A primary
      path is identified by 'name'.  A primary path is selected from the
      list to instantiate a primary forwarding LSP for the tunnel.  The
      list of primary paths is visited by order of preference.  A
      primary path has the following attributes:

      -  primary-reverse-path: A YANG container that holds properties of
         the primary reverse path.  The reverse path is applicable to
         bidirectional TE Tunnels.

      -  candidate-secondary-paths: A YANG container that holds a list
         of candidate secondary paths which may be used for the primary
         path to support path protection.  The candidate secondary
         path(s) reference path(s) from the tunnel secondary paths list.
         The preference of the secondary paths is specified within the
         list and dictates the order of visiting the secondary path from
         the list.  The attributes of a secondary path can be defined

         separately from the primary path.  The attributes of a
         secondary path will be inherited from the associated 'active'
         primary when not explicitly defined for the secondary path.


   secondary-paths:

      A YANG container that holds the set of secondary paths.  A
      secondary path is identified by 'name'.  A secondary path can be
      referenced from the TE Tunnel's 'candidate-secondary-path' list.
      A secondary path contains attributes similar to a primary path.

   secondary-reverse-paths:

      A YANG container that holds teh set of secondary reverse paths.  A
      secondary reverse path is identified by 'name'.  A secondary
      reverse path can be referenced from the TE Tunnel's 'candidate-
      secondary-reverse-paths' list.  A secondary reverse path contains
      attributes similar to a primary path.

   The following set common path attributes are shared for primary
   forward and reverse primary and secondary paths:

   compute-only:

      A path of TE Tunnel is, by default, provisioned so that it can is
      instantiated in forwarding to carry traffic as soon as a valid
      path is computed.  In some cases, a TE path may be provisioned for
      the only purpose of computing a path and reporting it without the
      need to instantiate the LSP or commit any resources.  In such a
      case, the path is configured in 'compute-only' mode to distinguish
      it from the default behavior.  A 'compute-only' path is configured
      as a usual with the associated per path constraint(s) and
      properties on a device or TE controller.  The device or TE
      controller computes the feasible path(s) subject to configured
      constraints.  A client may query the 'compute-only' computed path
      properties 'on-demand', or alternatively, can subscribe to be
      notified of computed path(s) and whenever the path properties
      change.

   use-path-computation:

      A YANG leaf that indicates whether or not path computation is to
      be used for a specified path.

      A YANG leaf that when set indicates the existing path should not
      be reoptimized after a failure on any of its traversed links.

   te-topology-identifier:

      A YANG container that holds the topology identifier associated
      with the tunnel.

   optimizations:

      a YANG container that holds the optimization objectives that path
      computation will use to select a path.

   computed-paths-properties: > A YANG container that holds properties
   for the list of computed paths.

   computed-path-error-infos:

      A YANG container that holds a list of errors related to the path.

   lsps:

      a YANG container that holds a list of LSPs that are instantiated
      for this specific path.

5.1.3.  TE LSPs

   The 'lsps' container includes the set of TE LSP(s) that are
   instantiated.  A TE LSP is identified by a 3-tuple ('tunnel-name',
   'node', 'lsp-id').

   When the model is used to manage a specific device, the 'lsps' list
   contains all TE LSP(s) that traverse the device (including
   ingressing, transiting and egressing the device).

   When the model is used to manage a TE controller, the 'lsps' list
   contains all TE LSP(s) that traverse all network devices (including
   ingressing, transiting and egressing the device) that the TE
   controller manages.

   Figure 8 shows the tree diagram of the generic TE YANG model defined
   in modules 'ietf-te.yang'.

6.  TE Device YANG Model

   The device TE YANG module ('ietf-te-device') models data that is
   specific to managing a TE device.  This module augments the generic
   TE YANG module.

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model              February 2022


6.1.  Module Structure

6.1.1.  TE Interfaces

   This branch of the model manages TE interfaces that are present on a
   device.  Examples of TE interface properties are:

   *  Maximum reservable bandwidth, bandwidth constraints (BC)

   *  Flooding parameters

      -  Flooding intervals and threshold values

   *  interface attributes

      -  (Extended) administrative groups

      -  SRLG values

      -  TE metric value

   *  Fast reroute backup tunnel properties (such as static, auto-
      tunnel)

   The derived state associated with interfaces is grouped under the
   interface "state" sub-container as shown in Figure 10.  This covers
   state data such as:

   *  Bandwidth information: maximum bandwidth, available bandwidth at
      different priorities and for each class-type (CT)

   *  List of admitted LSPs

      -  Name, bandwidth value and pool, time, priority

   *  Statistics: state counters, flooding counters, admission counters
      (accepted/rejected), preemption counters

   *  Adjacency information

      -  Neighbor address

      -  Metric value

7.  Notifications

   Notifications are a key component of any topology data model.

   [RFC8639] and [RFC8641] define a subscription mechanism and a push
   mechanism for YANG datastores.  These mechanisms currently allow the
   user to:

   *  Subscribe to notifications on a per-client basis.

   *  Specify subtree filters or XML Path Language (XPath) filters so
      that only contents of interest will be sent.

   *  Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

10.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model              February 2022


   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/te/globals": This module specifies the global TE configurations on
   a device.  Unauthorized access to this container could cause the
   device to ignore packets it should receive and process.

   "/te/tunnels": This list specifies the configuration and state of TE
   Tunnels present on the device or controller.  Unauthorized access to
   this list could cause the device to ignore packets it should receive
   and process.  An attacker may also use state to derive information
   about the network topology, and subsequently orchestrate further
   attacks.

   "/te/interfaces": This list specifies the configuration and state TE
   interfaces on a device.  Unauthorized access to this list could cause
   the device to ignore packets it should receive and process.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/te/lsps": this list contains information state about established
   LSPs in the network.  An attacker can use this information to derive
   information about the network topology, and subsequently orchestrate
   further attacks.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/te/tunnels-actions": using this RPC, an attacker can modify
   existing paths that may be carrying live traffic, and hence result to
   interruption to services carried over the network.

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model              February 2022


   "/te/tunnels-path-compute": using this RPC, an attacker can retrieve
   secured information about the network provider which can be used to
   orchestrate further attacks.

   The security considerations spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification
   [RFC7950] apply for this document as well.

   This section contains examples of use of the model with RESTCONF
   [RFC8040] and JSON encoding.

   For the example we will use a 4 node MPLS network were RSVP-TE MPLS
   Tunnels can be setup.  The loopbacks of each router are shown.  The
   network in Figure 13 will be used in the examples described in the
   following sections.

13.1.  Basic Tunnel Setup

   This example uses the TE Tunnel YANG data model defined in this
   document to create an RSVP-TE signaled Tunnel of packet LSP encoding
   type.  First, the TE Tunnel is created with no specific restrictions
   or constraints (e.g., protection or restoration).  The TE Tunnel
   ingresses on router A and egresses on router D.

   In this case, the TE Tunnel is created without specifying additional
   information about the primary paths.

13.2.  Global Named Path Constraints

   This example uses the YANG data model to create a 'named path
   constraitnt' that can be reference by TE Tunnels.  The path
   constraint, in this case, limits the TE Tunnel hops for the computed
   path.

   applied to the TE Tunnel created in Section 13.1.

13.4.  Tunnel with Per-tunnel Path Constraint

   In this example, the a per tunnel path constraint is explicitly
   indicated under the TE Tunnel created in Section 13.1 to constrain
   the computed path for the tunnel.
