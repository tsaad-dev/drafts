A YANG Data Model for Traffic Engineering Tunnels, Label Switched Paths,
                             and Interfaces
                       draft-ietf-teas-yang-te-39

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for the provisioning and
   management of Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels, Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), and interfaces.  The model covers data that is independent of
   any technology or dataplane encapsulation and is divided into two
   YANG modules that cover device-specific, and device independent data.

   This model covers data for configuration, operational state, remote
   procedural calls, and event notifications.

1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] and [RFC7950] is a data modeling language that was
   introduced to define the contents of a conceptual data store that
   allows networked devices to be managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG
   has proved relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other
   interfaces (e.g.  RESTCONF [RFC8040]) and encoding other than XML
   (e.g.  JSON) are being defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be
   used as the basis of implementation for other interfaces, such as CLI
   and programmatic APIs.

   This document describes a YANG data model for Traffic Engineering
   (TE) tunnels, Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and interfaces.  The data
   model is divided into two YANG modules.  The 'ietf-te' module
   includes data that is generic and device-independent, while the
   'ietf-te-device' module includes data that is device-specific.

   The document describes a high-level relationship between the modules
   defined in this document, as well as other external protocol YANG
   modules.  The TE generic YANG data model does not include any data
   specific to a signaling protocol.  It is expected other data plane
   technology models will augment the TE generic YANG data model.

   Also, it is expected other YANG modules that model TE signaling
   protocols, such as RSVP-TE ([RFC3209], [RFC3473]), or Segment-Routing
   TE (SR-TE) [RFC9256] will augment the generic TE YANG module.

2.3.  Model Tree Diagrams

   The tree diagrams extracted from the modules defined in this document
   are given in subsequent sections as per the syntax defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  Design Considerations

   This document describes a generic TE YANG data model that is
   independent of any dataplane technology.  One of the design
   objectives is to allow specific data plane technology models to reuse
   the TE generic data model and possibly augment it with technology
   specific data.

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model                  July 2025


   The elements of the generic TE YANG data model, including TE Tunnels,
   LSPs, and interfaces have leafs that identify the technology layer
   where they reside.  For example, the LSP encoding type can identify
   the technology associated with a TE Tunnel or LSP.

   Also, the generic TE YANG data model does not cover signaling
   protocol data.  The signaling protocols used to instantiate TE LSPs
   are outside the scope of this document and expected to be covered by
   augmentations defined in other documents.

   The following other design considerations are taken into account with
   respect to data organization:

   *  The device independent TE data is defined in 'ietf-te' module. and
      can be used to manage data off a device, such as a TE controller.
      When the model is used to manage a specific device, the model
      contains the TE Tunnels originating from the specific device.
      When the model is used to manage a TE controller, the 'tunnel'
      list contains all TE Tunnels and TE tunnel segments originating
      from devices that the TE controller manages.

   *  The device-specific TE data is defined in 'ietf-te-device' module.

   *  Minimal elements in the model are designated as "mandatory" to
      allow freedom to vendors to adapt the data model to their specific
      product implementation.

   *  Suitable defaults are specified for all configurable elements.

   *  Where TE functions or features might be optional within the
      deployed TE network, the model declares them as optional.

3.1.  State Data Organization

   The Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342]
   addresses modeling state data for ephemeral objects.  This document
   adopts the NMDA model for configuration and state data representation
   as per IETF guidelines for new IETF YANG data models.

4.  Model Overview

   The data models defined in this document cover the core TE features
   that are commonly supported by different vendor implementations.  The
   support of extended or vendor specific TE features is expected to
   either be in augmentations, or deviations to this model that are
   defined in separate documents.

4.1.  Module Relationship

   The generic TE YANG data model defined in 'ietf-te' module covers the
   building blocks that are device independent and agnostic of any
   specific technology or control plane instances.  The TE device YANG
   data model defined in 'ietf-te-device' module augments the 'ietf-te'
   module and covers data that is specific to a device -- for example,
   attributes of TE interfaces, or TE timers that are local to a TE
   node.

   The TE data models for specific instances of data plane technology
   and signaling protocols are outside the scope of this document.  They
   could be defined in separate YANG modules that augment the generic TE
   YANG data model.

5.  TE YANG Model

   The generic TE YANG data model defined in 'ietf-te' module supports
   the management and operation of a TE network.  This includes
   creating, modifying and retrieving information about TE Tunnels,
   LSPs, and interfaces and their associated attributes (e.g.
   Administrative-Groups, SRLGs, etc.).

   A full tree diagram of the TE YANG data model is shown in Appendix B.

5.1.  Module Structure

   The 'te' container is the top level container in the 'ietf-te'
   module.  The presence of the 'te' container enables TE function
   system wide.  Further descriptions of containers that exist under the
   'te' top level container are provided in the following sections.

   The three containers grouped under the 'te' container as shown in
   Figure 2 and described below.

   globals:

      The 'globals' container maintains the set of global TE attributes
      that can be applicable to TE Tunnels and interfaces.  Refer to
      Section 5.1.1 for further details.

   tunnels:

      The 'tunnels' container includes the list of TE Tunnels that are
      instantiated.  Refer to Section 5.1.2 for further details on the
      properties of a TE Tunnel.

   lsps:

      The 'lsps' container includes the list of TE LSPs that are
      instantiated for TE Tunnels.  Refer to Section 5.1.3 for further
      details on the properties of a TE LSP.

   The model also contains two Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) as shown in
   Appendix B and described below.

   tunnels-path-compute:

      An RPC to request path computation for a specific TE Tunnel.  The
      RPC allows requesting path computation using atomic and stateless
      operation.  A tunnel may also be configured in 'compute-only' mode
      to provide stateful path updates - see Section 5.1.2 for further
      details.

   tunnels-action:

      An RPC to request a specific action (e.g. reoptimize, or tear-and-
      setup) to be taken on a specific tunnel or all tunnels.

5.1.1.  TE Globals

   The 'globals' container covers properties that control a TE feature's
   behavior system-wide, and its respective state as shown in Figure 3
   and described in the text that follows.

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model                  July 2025


      A YANG container for the list of named (extended) administrative
      groups that may be applied to TE links.

   named-srlgs:

      A YANG container for the list of named Shared Risk Link Groups
      (SRLGs) that may be applied to TE links.

   named-path-constraints:

      A YANG container for a list of named path constraints.  Each named
      path constraint is composed of a set of constraints that can be
      applied during path computation.  A named path constraint can be
      applied to multiple TE Tunnels.  Path constraints may also be
      specified directly under the TE Tunnel.  The path constraints
      specified under the TE Tunnel take precedence over the path
      constraints derived from the referenced named path constraint.  A
      named path constraint entry can be formed of the path constraints
      shown in Figure 4:

               Figure 4: Named path constraints YANG subtree

         o  name: A YANG leaf that holds the named path constraint
            entry.  This is unique in the list and used as a key.

         o  te-bandwidth: A YANG container that holds the technology
            agnostic TE bandwidth constraint.

         o  link-protection: A YANG leaf that holds the link protection
            type constraint required for the links to be included in the
            computed path.

         o  setup/hold priority: YANG leafs that hold the LSP setup and
            hold admission priority as defined in [RFC3209].

         o  signaling-type: A YANG leaf that holds the LSP setup type,
            such as RSVP-TE or SR.

         o  path-metric-bounds: A YANG container that holds the set of
            metric bounds applicable on the computed TE tunnel path.

         o  path-affinities-values: A YANG container that holds the set
            of affinity values and mask to be used during path
            computation.

         o  path-affinity-names: A YANG container that holds the set of
            named affinity constraints and corresponding inclusion or
            exclusion instructions for each to be used during path
            computation.

         o  path-srlgs-lists: A YANG container that holds the set of
            SRLG values and corresponding inclusion or exclusion
            instructions to be used during path computation.

         o  path-srlgs-names: A YANG container that holds the set of
            named SRLG constraints and corresponding inclusion or
            exclusion instructions for each to be used during path
            computation.

         o  disjointness: The level of resource disjointness constraint
            that the secondary path of a TE tunnel has to adhere to.

         o  explicit-route-objects: A YANG container that holds path
            constraints in the form of route entries present in
            following two lists:

            +  'route-object-exclude-always': a list of route entries
               that are always excluded from the path computation.  The
               exclusion of a route entry in this list during path
               computation is not order sensitive.

            +  'route-object-include-exclude': a list of route entries
               to include or exclude route entry constraints for the
               path computation.  The constraint type (include or
               exclude) is specified with each route entry.  The path
               computation considers route entry constraints in the
               order they appear in this list.  Once a route entry
               constraint is consumed from this list, it is not
               considered any further in the computation of the path.
               The 'route-object-include-exclude' is used to configure
               constraints on which route objects (e.g., nodes, links)
               are included or excluded in the path computation.  The
               interpretation of an empty 'route-object-include-exclude'
               list depends on the TE Tunnel (end-to-end or Tunnel
               Segment) and on the specific path, according to the
               following rules:

               1.  An empty 'route-object-include-exclude' list for the
                   primary path of an end-to-end TE Tunnel indicates
                   that there are no route objects to be included or
                   excluded in the path computation.

               2.  An empty 'route-object-include-exclude' list for the
                   primary path of a TE Tunnel Segment indicates that no
                   primary LSP is required for that TE Tunnel.

               3.  An empty 'route-object-include-exclude' list for a
                   reverse path means it always follows the forward path
                   (i.e., the TE Tunnel is co-routed).  When the 'route-
                   object-include-exclude' list is not empty, the
                   reverse path is routed independently of the forward
                   path.

               4.  An empty 'route-object-include-exclude' list for the
                   secondary (forward) path indicates that the secondary
                   path has the same endpoints as the primary path.

         o  path-in-segment: A YANG container that contains a list of
            label restrictions that have to be taken into considerations
            when stitching to another tunnel segment such as at a domain
            boundary.  The TE tunnel segment in this case is being
            stitched to the upstream TE tunnel segment.

            label restrictions that have to be taken into considerations
            when stitching to another tunnel segment such as at a domain
            boundary.  The TE tunnel segment in this case is being

                 Figure 5: TE Tunnel YANG subtree structure

   When the model is used to manage a specific device, the 'tunnel' list
   contains the TE Tunnels originating from the specific device.  When
   the model is used to manage a TE controller, the 'tunnel' list
   contains all TE Tunnels and TE tunnel segments originating from
   devices that the TE controller manages.

   The TE Tunnel model allows the configuration and management of the
   following TE tunnel objects:

   TE Tunnel:

      A YANG container of one or more TE LSPs established between the
      source and destination TE Tunnel termination points.

   TE Path:

      An engineered path that once instantiated in the forwarding plane
      can be used to forward traffic from the source to the destination
      TE Tunnel termination points.

   TE LSP:

      A TE LSP is a connection-oriented service established over a TE
      Path and that allows the delivery of traffic between the TE Tunnel
      source and destination termination points.

   TE Tunnel Segment:

      A segment of a TE Tunnel that is stitched with other segments in
      order to provision end-to-end tunnel.

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model                  July 2025


   The TE Tunnel has a number of attributes that are set directly under
   the tunnel (as shown in Figure 5).  The main attributes of a TE
   Tunnel are described below:

   name:

      A YANG leaf that holds the name of a TE Tunnel.  The name of the
      TE Tunnel uniquely identifies the tunnel within the TE tunnel
      list.  The name of the TE Tunnel can be formatted as a Uniform
      Resource Indicator (URI) by including the namespace to ensure
      uniqueness of the name amongst all the TE Tunnels present on
      devices and controllers.  The configured TE Tunnels can be
      reported with the name of the device embedded within the TE Tunnel
      name.  For TE Tunnels initiated by the controller, the controller
      is responsible to ensure that TE Tunnel names are unique.

   alias:

      A YANG leaf that holds an alternate name to the TE tunnel.  Unlike
      the TE tunnel name, the alias can be modified at any time during
      the lifetime of the TE tunnel.

   identifier:

      A YANG leaf that holds an identifier of the tunnel.  This
      identifier is unique amongst tunnels originated from the same
      ingress device.

   color:

      A YANG leaf that holds the color associated with the TE tunnel.
      The color is used to map or steer services that carry matching
      color on to the TE tunnel as described in [RFC9012].

   admin-state:

      A YANG leaf that holds the tunnel administrative state.

   operational-state:

      A YANG leaf that holds the tunnel operational state.

   encoding/switching:

      The 'encoding' and 'switching-type' are YANG leafs that define the
      specific technology in which the tunnel operates in as described
      in [RFC3945].

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model                  July 2025


   source/destination:

      YANG containers that hold the tunnel source and destination node
      endpoint identities, including:

      -  te-node-id: A YANG leaf that holds the TE node identifier (as
         defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-rfc8776-update]) of the source
         or destination of the TE Tunnel.

      -  node-id: A YANG leaf that holds the node identifier (as defined
         in [RFC8345]) of the source or destination of the TE Tunnel.

      -  tunnel-tp-id: A YANG leaf that holds the identifier of the
         source or destination of the TE Tunnel Termination Points
         (TTPs) as defined in [RFC8795].  The TTP identifiers are
         optional on nodes that have a single TTP per node.  For
         example, TTP identifiers are optional for packet (IP/MPLS)
         routers.

   bidirectional:

      A YANG leaf that when present indicates the LSP of a TE Tunnel is
      bidirectional as defined in [rfc3473].

   controller:

      A YANG container that holds tunnel data relevant to an optional
      external TE controller that may initiate or control a tunnel.
      This target node may be augmented by external modules, for
      example, to add data for Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
      initiated and/or delegated tunnels.

   reoptimize-timer:

      A YANG leaf to set the interval period for tunnel reoptimization.

   association-objects:

      A YANG container that holds the set of associations of the TE
      Tunnel to other TE Tunnels.  Associations at the TE Tunnel level
      apply to all paths of the TE Tunnel.  The TE tunnel associations
      can be overridden by associations configured directly under the TE
      Tunnel path.

   protection:

      A YANG container that holds the TE Tunnel protection properties.

   restoration:

      A YANG container that holds the TE Tunnel restoration properties.

   te-topology-identifier:

      A YANG container that holds the topology identifier associated
      with the topology where paths for the TE tunnel are computed as
      defined in [RFC8795].

   network-id:

      A YANG leaf that can optionally be used to identify the network
      topology where paths for the TE tunnel are computed as defined in
      [RFC8345].

   hierarchy:

      A YANG container that holds hierarchy related properties of the TE
      Tunnel.  A TE LSP can be set up in MPLS or Generalized MPLS
      (GMPLS) networks to be used as a TE link to carry traffic in other
      (client) networks [RFC6107].  In this case, the model introduces
      the TE Tunnel hierarchical link endpoint parameters to identify
      the specific link in the client layer that the underlying TE
      Tunnel is associated with.  The hierarchy container includes the
      following:

      -  dependency-tunnels: A hierarchical set of TE Tunnels either
         provisioned or to be provisioned in the immediate lower layer,
         upon which the current TE Tunnel relies for multi-layer path
         computation.  A dependency TE Tunnel is provisioned if it has
         been selected by path computation to support at least one
         client-layer TE Tunnel.  When a dependency TE Tunnel is
         provisioned, it makes TE link operational in the client layer's
         network topology, enabling the provisioning of TE Tunnels in
         the client layer.

      -  hierarchical-link: A YANG container that holds the identity of
         the hierarchical link (in the client layer) that is supported
         by this TE Tunnel.  The endpoints of the hierarchical link are
         defined by TE tunnel source and destination node endpoints.
         The hierarchical link can be identified by its source and
         destination link termination point identifiers.

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model                  July 2025


      A YANG container that holds the list of primary paths.  A primary
      path is identified by 'name'.  A primary path is selected from the
      list to instantiate a primary forwarding LSP for the tunnel.  The
      list of primary paths is visited by order of preference.  A
      primary path has the following attributes:

      -  primary-reverse-path: A YANG container that holds properties of
         the primary reverse path.  The reverse path is applicable to
         bidirectional TE Tunnels.

      -  candidate-secondary-paths: A YANG container that holds a list
         of candidate secondary paths which may be used for the primary
         path to support path protection.  The candidate secondary paths
         reference paths from the tunnel secondary paths list.  The
         preference of the secondary paths is specified within the list
         and dictates the order of visiting the secondary path from the
         list.  The attributes of a secondary path can be defined
         separately from the primary path.  The attributes of a
         secondary path will be inherited from the associated 'active'
         primary when not explicitly defined for the secondary path.


   secondary-paths:

      A YANG container that holds the set of secondary paths.  A
      secondary path is identified by 'name'.  A secondary path can be
      referenced from the TE Tunnel's 'candidate-secondary-path' list.

   secondary-reverse-paths:

      A YANG container that holds the set of secondary reverse paths.  A
      secondary reverse path is identified by 'name'.  A secondary
      reverse path can be referenced from the TE Tunnel's 'candidate-
      secondary-reverse-paths' list.  A secondary reverse path is
      modeled with the same data attributes as those of the primary
      path.

   The following set of common path attributes are shared for primary
   (forward and reverse) and secondary paths:

   path-computation-method:

      A YANG leaf that specifies the method used for computing the TE
      path.

   path-computation-server:

      A YANG container that holds the path computation server properties
      when the path is externally queried.

   compute-only:

      A path of a TE Tunnel is, by default, provisioned so that it can
      be instantiated in the forwarding plane so that it can carry
      traffic as soon as a valid path is computed.  In some cases, a TE
      path may be configured only for the purpose of computing a path
      and reporting it without the need to instantiate the LSP or commit
      any resources.  In such a case, the path is configured in
      'compute-only' mode to distinguish it from the default behavior.
      A 'compute-only' path is configured as usual with the associated
      per path constraints and properties on a device or TE controller.
      The device or TE controller computes the feasible paths subject to
      configured constraints.  A client may query the 'compute-only'
      computed path properties 'on-demand', or alternatively, can
      subscribe to be notified of computed paths and whenever the path
      properties change.

   use-path-computation:

      A YANG leaf that indicates whether or not path computation is to
      be used for a specified path.

   lockdown:

      A YANG leaf that when set indicates the existing path should not
      be globally repaired or reoptimized.

   path-scope:

      A YANG leaf that specifies whether the path is a segment or an
      end-to-end path.

   preference:

      A YANG leaf that specifies the preference for the path, used to
      choose between paths in a list.  The lower the number, the higher
      the preference.  Paths with the same preference are treated as
      equal and other methods are used to choose between them.

   k-requested-paths:

      A YANG leaf that specifies the number of k-shortest-paths
      requested from the path computation server and returned sorted by
      its optimization objective.

      A YANG container that holds the list of path computation error
      information.  The TE system populates entries in this list
      whenever an error is encountered during the compuation of the TE
      path.

   path-compute-info:

      A YANG grouping that contains leafs representing the path
      attributes that are passed to the TE path computation engine to be
      considered during the path computation.  This includes:

      -  path constraints,

      -  path optimization objectives, and

      -  path assocociations

      Note, unless overriden under a specific path of the TE tunnel, the
      TE tunnel's primary path constraints, optimization objectives, and
      associations are inherited by the primary reverse path, secondary
      path and secondary reverse path.

   lsps:

      A YANG container that holds a list of LSPs that have been
      instantiated for this specific path.

   In addition to the path common attributes, the primary path has the
   following attributes that are not present in the secondary path:

   *  Only the primary path contains the list of 'candidate-secondary-
      paths' that can protect the primary path.

   *  Only the primary path can contain a primary-reverse-path
      associated with the primary path (and its associated list of
      'candidate-secondary-reverse-path').

5.1.3.  TE LSPs

   The 'lsps' container includes the set of TE LSPs that have been
   instantiated.  A TE LSP is identified by a 3-tuple ('tunnel-name',
   'lsp-id', 'node').

   When the model is used to manage a specific device, the 'lsps' list
   contains all TE LSPs that traverse the device (including ingressing,
   transiting and egressing the device).

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model                  July 2025


   When the model is used to manage a TE controller, the 'lsps' list
   contains the TE LSPs on devices managed by the controller that act as
   ingress, and may optionally include TE LSPs on devices managed by the
   controller that act as transit or egress role.

6.  TE Device YANG Model

   The device TE YANG module ('ietf-te-device') models data that is
   specific to managing a TE device.  This module augments the generic
   TE YANG module.

6.1.  Module Structure

6.1.1.  TE Interfaces

   This branch of the model manages TE interfaces that are present on a
   device.  Examples of TE interface properties are:

   *  Maximum reservable bandwidth, bandwidth constraints (BC)

   *  Flooding parameters

      -  Flooding intervals and threshold values

   *  Interface attributes

      -  (Extended) administrative groups

      -  SRLG values

      -  TE metric value

   *  Fast reroute backup tunnel properties (such as static, auto-
      tunnel)

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model                  July 2025


   The derived state associated with interfaces is grouped under the
   interface "state" sub-container as shown in Figure 7.  This covers
   state data such as:

   *  Bandwidth information: maximum bandwidth, available bandwidth at
      different priorities and for each class-type (CT)

   *  List of admitted LSPs

      -  Name, bandwidth value and pool, time, priority

   *  Statistics: state counters, flooding counters, admission counters
      (accepted/rejected), preemption counters

   *  Adjacency information

      -  Neighbor address

      -  Metric value

7.  Notifications

   Notifications are a key component of any topology data model.

   [RFC8639] and [RFC8641] define a subscription mechanism and a push
   mechanism for YANG datastores.  These mechanisms currently allow the
   user to:

   *  Subscribe to notifications on a per-client basis.

   *  Specify subtree filters or XML Path Language (XPath) filters so
      that only contents of interest will be sent.

   *  Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following URIs in the IETF XML registry
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the following
   registrations are requested to be made.

      Name:       ietf-te
      Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te

      Name:       ietf-te-device
      Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-te-device
      Prefix:     te-device
      Reference:  RFCXXXX

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/te/globals": This module specifies the global TE configurations on
   a device.  Unauthorized access to this container could cause the
   device to ignore packets it should receive and process.

Internet-Draft             TE YANG Data Model                  July 2025


   "/te/tunnels": This list specifies the configuration and state of TE
   Tunnels present on the device or controller.  Unauthorized access to
   this list could cause the device to ignore packets it should receive
   and process.  An attacker may also use state to derive information
   about the network topology, and subsequently orchestrate further
   attacks.

   "/te/interfaces": This list specifies the configuration and state TE
   interfaces on a device.  Unauthorized access to this list could cause
   the device to ignore packets it should receive and process.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/te/lsps": this list contains information state about established
   LSPs in the network.  An attacker can use this information to derive
   information about the network topology, and subsequently orchestrate
   further attacks.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/te/tunnels-actions": using this RPC, an attacker can modify
   existing paths that may be carrying live traffic, and hence result to
   interruption to services carried over the network.

   "/te/tunnels-path-compute": using this RPC, an attacker can retrieve
   secured information about the network provider which can be used to
   orchestrate further attacks.

   The security considerations spelled out in the YANG 1.1 specification
   [RFC7950] apply for this document as well.

Appendix A.  Data Tree Examples

   This section contains examples of use of the model with RESTCONF
   [RFC8040] and JSON encoding.

   For the example we will use a 4 node MPLS network were RSVP-TE MPLS
   Tunnels can be setup.  The loopbacks of each router are shown.  The
   network in Figure 9 will be used in the examples described in the
   following sections.

A.1.  Basic Tunnel Setup

   This example uses the TE Tunnel YANG data model defined in this
   document to create an RSVP-TE signaled Tunnel of packet LSP encoding
   type.  First, the TE Tunnel is created with no specific restrictions
   or constraints (e.g., protection or restoration).  The TE Tunnel
   ingresses on router A and egresses on router D.

   In this case, the TE Tunnel is created without specifying additional
   information about the primary paths.

A.2.  Global Named Path Constraints

   This example uses the YANG data model to create a 'named path
   constraint' that can be reference by TE Tunnels.  The path
   constraint, in this case, limits the TE Tunnel hops for the computed
   path.

       }
      }
     }
   }

A.3.  Tunnel with Global Path Constraint

   In this example, the previously created 'named path constraint' is
   applied to the TE Tunnel created in Appendix A.1.

     ]
   }

A.4.  Tunnel with Per-tunnel Path Constraint

   In this example, the a per tunnel path constraint is explicitly
   indicated under the TE Tunnel created in Appendix A.1 to constrain
   the computed path for the tunnel.
